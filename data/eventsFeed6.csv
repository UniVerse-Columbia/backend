While traditional security (e.g., encryption) prevents unauthorized access tomessage content, detection of the mere presence of a message by the adversary can havea significant negative impact. This necessitates the use of covert communication, which notonly protects the information contained in a transmission from unauthorized decoding, butalso prevents the detection of a transmission in the first place. Although practical radio-frequency covert communication systems have been around since the advent of spread-spectrum, exploration of their fundamental limits is a new direction in information theory.Surprisingly, analysis of covert communication systems reveals that, while the Shannoncapacity of a covert communication channel is zero, it still allows transmission of a largevolume of covert data. This is true even when covert communications are secure fromdetection by a quantum-enabled adversary.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will present these fundamentalresults, focusing on their intuitive explanation, rather than their mathematical derivations. Iwill also describe a table-top proof-of-concept validation that paved the way for the ongoingexperimental studies in quantum-secure covert communication.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nBio: Boulat A.

The series will focus on frank, practical, scientific and technological discussions on the prospects of new technologies in the energy world. Each session will bring together experts to focus on a different energy technology. This session will be co-hosted by&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Matt Bowen&lt;/strong&gt;, CGEP Research Scholar.&lt;br /&gt;\n&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\nEnergy technologies in the last twenty years have advanced significantly, and much of what is currently being deployed, including now-prevalent technologies such as solar, wind, batteries, and advanced drilling, was not commercially available in the not-so-distant past.

This Cas13d-mediated target RNA knockdown can be superior to existing DNA-targeting CRISPR technologies, enabling unambiguous targeting of non-coding RNAs, RNA isoforms, or RNA viruses; and delivery of multiple guide RNAs (gRNAs) at the same time. Here, I am highlighting the utility of Cas13d for the scientific community, first by thoroughly defining the requirements for gRNA design and by developing a pipeline for transcriptome-wide forward genetic pooled screens. And finally, by combining the high throughput of pooled Cas13 screens with content-rich phenotyping of single-cell perturbation approaches to study genetic interactions with multimodal readout.&lt;/p&gt;","","2022-02-28 18:36:02","X-BEDEWORK-REGISTRATION-GUEST-ACCESS : values : text : 	email,X-BEDEWORK-IMAGE : values : text : /public/images/thumbnail_Photo_Wessels-202202250315.jpg,X-BEDEWORK-THUMB-IMAGE : values : text : 	/public/images/thumbnail_Photo_Wessels-202202250315-thumb.png,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-hiccc/Location/Medical Center,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-hiccc/Type/Seminar,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-hiccc/Events open to/Alumni,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-hiccc/Events open to/Faculty,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-hiccc/Events open to/Family Friendly,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-hiccc/Events open to/Graduate Students,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-hiccc/Events open to/Postdocs,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-hiccc/Events open to/Prospective Students,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-hiccc/Events open to/Public,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-hiccc/Events open to/Staff,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-hiccc/Events open to/Student,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-hiccc/Events open to/Trainees,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-hiccc/Category/Basic Health Sciences,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-hiccc/Category/College of Physicians and Surgeons,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-hiccc/Category/Research,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-hiccc/Category/Natural Sciences,X-BEDEWORK-SHORTTITLE : values : text : HICCC Distinguished Speaker Seminar,X-BEDEWORK-SUBMITTEDBY : values : text : sgf2 for Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (agrp_hiccc),X-BEDEWORK-DESCRIPTION-FORMAT : values : text : html,X-BEDEWORK-CALSUITE : values : text : Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center"

Where do our best ideas come from? Join us for a conversation with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=""https://columbiasocialenterprise.org/civicrm/mailing/url?u=37727&amp;amp;qid=""&gt;Professor Sheena Iyengar&lt;/a&gt;, who will touch on how innovation &amp;mdash; whether that be as an environmental entrepreneur, within a business or field of discipline, or in our personal lives and how we impact the environment &amp;mdash; begins with a creative spark and the tools that can be used to find your spark of innovation to address the global climate change crisis.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Think Bigger Innovation Method utilizes decision-making theory, cognitive science, and industry practice to facilitate creativity and innovation for complex problem solving that is both novel and useful. Using cognitive science, Think Bigger provides a six-step method for innovation that is unlike any other. Whether a problem is related to social discourse, the transition to net zero, or supply chain sustainability and logistics, The Think Bigger Innovation Method fosters both interdisciplinary teamwork and constructive interactions that draw on every individual&amp;rsquo;s experience and expertise. The method focuses on defining and refining a problem, while learning to deconstruct and verbalize that problem to surface and reduce bias. It also privileges searching outside the self, going far beyond customer insight, and exploring the history of true innovation. At its heart, Think Bigger relies on structured persistence, multi-domain research, and combinatory experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=""https://columbiasocialenterprise.org/civicrm/event/register?id=849&amp;amp;reset=1"" target=""_blank""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RSVP &amp;rarr;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;","","2022-02-28 18:37:15","X-BEDEWORK-REGISTRATION-GUEST-ACCESS : values : text : 	email,X-BEDEWORK-IMAGE : values : text : /public/images/Climate Solutions LInkedIn Event Image - 3.2.22-202202240456.png,X-BEDEWORK-THUMB-IMAGE : values : text : 	/public/images/Climate Solutions LInkedIn Event Image - 3.2.22-202202240456-thumb.png,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-TamerCenter/Location/Online,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-TamerCenter/Events open to/Alumni,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-TamerCenter/Events open to/Faculty,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-TamerCenter/Events open to/Family Friendly,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-TamerCenter/Events open to/Graduate Students,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-TamerCenter/Events open to/Postdocs,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-TamerCenter/Events open to/Prospective Students,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-TamerCenter/Events open to/Public,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-TamerCenter/Events open to/Staff,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-TamerCenter/Events open to/Student,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-TamerCenter/Events open to/Trainees,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-TamerCenter/Category/Business,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-TamerCenter/Type/Lecture,X-BEDEWORK-SUBMITTEDBY : values : text : hs2948 for Tamer Center for Social Enterprise (agrp_TamerCenter),X-BEDEWORK-DESCRIPTION-FORMAT : values : text : html,X-BEDEWORK-CALSUITE : values : text : Tamer Center for Social Enterprise,X-BEDEWORK-SHORTTITLE : values : text : Using the Think Bigger Method to Find Climate Change Solutions"

From local government initiatives in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to renewed discussions about an HR 40 Bill at the federal Congress level, redress for centuries of racialized forms of violence is on the public and official political agenda.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIn this panel, scholars of redress will discuss the trajectory of the reparations movement in the U.S., as well as explore enduring barriers to reparatory justice. We will furthermore examine methods for rectifying systemic inequality that has resulted from past and ongoing forms of racial discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Amendment Project (TAP) is a student-led organization seeking to drive young people to join the movement for reparations. Through city-council level campaigns like the one in Tulsa in 2021 and workshops hosted with organizations like the ACLU and university and high school organizations, TAP works to mobilize through student lobbying and providing educational resources on reparations in a modern context.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speakers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- Katherine M.

Sovereignty, soliloquy, sonnet (sonata), (in)sovereignty, sound, sequence (sequins), syncopation and self(lessness) are all over our minds because of Henry V or, as his friends call him, Hank Cinq. In addition to lisps becoming more naked and emphatic with every hissing breath, certain obsessions of, which these words bear, become more apparent as well. The obsessions are physical and sociological problems, which will fall under the rubric of chance and incalculability and we&amp;rsquo;ll need some guidance (from W. E. B. Du Bois and Stephen Booth) to be able to discern how indeterminacy and unruliness are the heart of the matter of the sonnet and their non-binary sister, the soliloquy. We might begin to consider the force of the solo in the soliloquy but if we do it&amp;rsquo;s because that force is the sound of the unalone and the non-aligned. The single-line&amp;rsquo;s striational transgression of the line is itself striated, an involuntary muscular shredding of the sonnet that might be said to operate as a kind of anticipatory anti-coloniality in the sonnet, a resistance to constraint and control, Hank&amp;rsquo;s revelation and undoing of himself, which it is ours to deepen, extend, and swing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This event is free and open to everyone but registration is required.

It is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that impacts societies in multiple ways. It affects the development of democracies and the rule of law, weakens government institutions, hinders economic growth, degrades the environment, and ramp up the violation of human rights. The transnational flow of people, materials, and information has remarkably increased the levels of interactions at different spatial and administrative scales. Consequently, large networks of interrelated players across borders developing complex corruption structures and schemes are seen in cases such as the Pandora Papers or Odebrecht, while national corruption scandals involving business, shell companies, government officials, and political parties are equally escalated in many countries of the Americas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In a more connected world than ever, larger amounts of data and information are also produced massively from various sources, ranging from journalism, civil society organizations, oversight agencies, and government. Nevertheless, political use of criminal justice, constant budget cutbacks to prosecution and accountability institutions, degradation of operation capacity, and selective austerity policies pose new challenges for intelligence, prosecution, and policymaking.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This conference addresses a regions&amp;#39; paradox: while more sophisticated national and transnational corruption schemes expand, the institutional capacities of governments to prevent and combat corruption are being eroded. What should innovative anti-corruption strategies look like, and what are the key influential actors in this context?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Speakers:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sergio L&amp;oacute;pez Ayll&amp;oacute;n, CIDE, Mexico.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Roberto Saba, Unversidad de Palermo, Argentina.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cristian Priscoff, University of Chile, Chile.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Peniley Ram&amp;iacute;rez, NYC-based Journalist.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Carmen Elo&amp;iacute;sa Ruiz, Externado University, Colombia&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Vladimir Aras, Federal Appelate Prosecutor, Brasil&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Moderators:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hugo Concha, IIJ-UNAM&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Issa Luna-Pla, Visiting Scholar at Columbia University&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJIude6prD4qEtS_w-5z18kHGRjrpQ-l2qch&nbsp;"" target=""_blank""&gt;Click here to register.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;","","2022-03-08 18:26:48","X-BEDEWORK-REGISTRATION-GUEST-ACCESS : values : text : 	email,X-BEDEWORK-IMAGE : values : text : /public/images/Screen Shot 2022-02-17 at 12.22.55 PM-202202171224.png,X-BEDEWORK-THUMB-IMAGE : values : text : 	/public/images/Screen Shot 2022-02-17 at 12.22.55 PM-202202171224-thumb.png,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Location/Online,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Type/Conference,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Events open to/Alumni,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Events open to/Faculty,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Events open to/Graduate Students,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Events open to/Postdocs,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Events open to/Prospective Students,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Events open to/Public,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Events open to/Staff,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Events open to/Student,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Events open to/Trainees,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Category/Humanities,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Category/International and Public Affairs,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Category/Journalism,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Category/Law,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Category/Political Science,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Category/School of Social Work,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Category/Social Justice,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Category/Social Sciences,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Group-Specific/Mexico,X-BEDEWORK-SHORTTITLE : values : text : The Erosion of Institutional Capacity to Combat Corruption,X-BEDEWORK-SUBMITTEDBY : values : text : apc2170 for ILAS (agrp_ilas),X-BEDEWORK-DESCRIPTION-FORMAT : values : text : html,X-BEDEWORK-CALSUITE : values : text : ILAS"

Our laboratory uses this &amp;ldquo;whisking&amp;rdquo; behavior as a model to study how animal nervous systems actively gather and process complex sensorimotor information. There are no sensors along the length of each whisker, so a whisking animal must form a three-dimensional (3D) tactile impression of the environment based on mechanical signals at the whisker bases. In this talk, I will describe studies that examine how a rodent might use information about whisker bending to extract the 3D contour of an object, and how primary sensory neurons of the trigeminal ganglion (Vg) represent these mechanical signals. Analysis of the neural activity suggests that individual Vg neurons simultaneously represent multiple mechanical features of a given stimulus, and that the neurons employ a distributed code to account for all available mechanical information. These results are guiding our development of simulation systems for whisking mechanics and whisking robots.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT THE SPEAKER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitra J.

Large velocities and high melt rates are thought to occur adjacent to highly turbulent subglacial discharge plumes. However, recent observations demonstrate that melt rates are also high far away from plumes, suggesting that other ocean processes may facilitate heat and salt fluxes to the ice-ocean interface. Using extensive in situ observations, as well as idealised large eddy simulations, we demonstrate that the subglacial discharge plume emanating from LeConte Glacier, Alaska, generates an energetic internal gravity wave field. The waves are persistent in time and fill the near-glacier fjord, accounting for ~ 50 % of the total observed kinetic energy near the ice-ocean boundary during the two-week September 2018 field campaign. They are characterised by coherent oscillations in velocity of magnitude 1 - 8 cm/s with a period of ~ 10 mins (close to the local buoyancy period) and a horizontal wavelength of 150 - 200 m. The signal was identified in two separate mooring records, one of which was located within 100 m of the terminus, suggesting that internal waves have the potential to enhance melting by driving flow directly at the ice-ocean interface. Accounting for wave velocities within a commonly used melt parameterisation, which assumes shear-driven boundary layer dynamics, results in a 40 - 80 % increase in the estimated melt rate relative to ambient (no wave) conditions.,X-BEDEWORK-DESCRIPTION-FORMAT : values : text : html"

Engerman&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;(Yale University) will serve as discussant, with&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Valentina Izmirlieva&lt;/strong&gt;, Director of the Harriman Institute, as moderator.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It is well known that the Harriman Institute&amp;rsquo;s predecessor, the Russian Institute, established in 1946, was the first area studies center in the United States devoted to multidisciplinary teaching of and research on Russia. David Engerman&amp;rsquo;s path-breaking monograph &lt;em&gt;Know Your Enemy&lt;/em&gt; relates the focused philanthropy with which the Rockefeller Foundation began to support area studies in the 1930s, encouraged innovations during World War II, and finally poured over a million dollars into the Columbia project, making it preeminent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What is less well known is that the Rockefeller Foundation was not only interested in establishing area studies in the US for patriotic purposes, but also made grants in the late 1940s and 1950s to set up or strengthen area studies centers all over the &amp;ldquo;free world&amp;rdquo; in order to provide cross-cutting knowledge to policy communities everywhere in the hope that better information would lead to better international relations. These connections radiating from New York can be construed as an additional Cold War front. In this project, Slavic Studies would have a special place, and Columbia, the flagship of American Slavic studies, would serve as both model for and host to leading scholars with leading roles at their home institutions.&amp;nbsp;This research makes use of Rockefeller Foundation and Columbia University archives, as well as memoir materials from Japan and Germany.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Ways to Attend&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_FlzKRh54T1WeV0geShfJhA"" target=""_blank""&gt;Register for Zoom Webinar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/xGkDEOVE8nA"" target=""_blank""&gt;Watch on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In-person (CUID Only):&lt;strong&gt; Reserve Your Seat&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(see button below)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;","","2022-02-25 21:53:57","X-BEDEWORK-WAIT-LIST-LIMIT : values : text : 	0,X-BEDEWORK-REGISTRATION-START : values : text : 20220216T000000,X-BEDEWORK-UNI-ONLY-REG : values : text : 	YES,X-BEDEWORK-REGISTRATION-END : values : text : 20220304T130000,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Type/Lecture,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Alumni,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Faculty,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Family Friendly,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Graduate Students,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Postdocs,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Prospective Students,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Public,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Staff,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Student,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Trainees,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Category/International and Public Affairs,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Location/Morningside,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Group Specific/Russia,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Type/Discussion,X-BEDEWORK-MAX-TICKETS-PER-USER : values : text : 	1,X-BEDEWORK-MAX-TICKETS : values : text : 	100,X-BEDEWORK-SUBMITTEDBY : values : text : pb2855 for SIPA_HarrimanInstitute (agrp_SIPA_HarrimanInstitute),X-BEDEWORK-CUSTOM-URL-LABEL : values : text : For more information, please visit the Harriman Institute website,X-BEDEWORK-DESCRIPTION-FORMAT : values : text : html,X-BEDEWORK-CALSUITE : values : text : SIPA - Harriman Institute,X-BEDEWORK-REG-BUTTON-TEXT : values : text : Reserve Your Seat,X-BEDEWORK-SHORTTITLE : values : text : POSTPONED.

Please note that because these sessions are workshops, the recordings will not be available.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;From October 2021 to May 2022, the Irish poet and conflict mediator&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;P&amp;aacute;draig &amp;Oacute; Tuama&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;will be in residence with the International Center for Cooperation and Conflict Resolution at Teachers College, as well as Columbia&amp;rsquo;s Earth Institute, Columbia Climate School.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;His project during this time is exploring dynamics of conflict and sustainability through the lens of poetry.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Poetry is a communicative technology that has emerged from every culture on earth. For as long as there&amp;rsquo;s been literature, individuals have turned to poetry for the purpose of communicating what mere sentences cannot communicate. At poetry&amp;rsquo;s heart can be ambivalence, rage, lament, resistance, regression, the murky world of dreams, and anxiety. In this way, poetry is primed to provide interest into the human animal&amp;rsquo;s behavior during times of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The outcome of P&amp;aacute;draig &amp;Oacute; Tuama&amp;#39;s residency at Columbia will be a publication that will pair 35 poems with insight about conflict - connecting them with major themes expressed in the award-winning&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Handbook of Conflict Resolution: Theory and Practice&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(2014). This includes conflict between individuals; conflict in groups; ambivalent responses to conflict; regression, aggression, and resistance; cooperation and negotiation; as well as conflict as a state of existence in the current climate crisis. Ground Rules will explore what it means to be grounded in human emotion, in physical space, in historical and post-colonial contexts, and in collaboration with each other for the purpose of moving towards flourishing and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;P&amp;aacute;draig &amp;Oacute; Tuama presents&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Poetry Unbound&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;from&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;On Being&lt;/em&gt;, a podcast that began in early 2020. Just about to start its fourth season in the Fall of 2021, this podcast has already exceeded six million downloads. A book from the podcast is forthcoming (October 2021) from WW Norton.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;P&amp;aacute;draig &amp;Oacute; Tuama&amp;rsquo;s published work includes poetry (Readings from the Book of Exile, Sorry for your Troubles, Canterbury Press 2012 and 2013), Theology (Daily Prayer and Borders and Belonging; Canterbury Press 2017 and 2021) and memoir In the Shelter (Broadleaf Books, 2021). A former leader of Corrymeela, Ireland&amp;rsquo;s oldest peace organisation, he combines interest in language, religion and conflict in all his written work. A frequent guest on long-form radio, his interviews have been featured on national broadcasters in Ireland, the UK, the USA, Australia and New Zealand. His poems have been published in the Harvard Review, Gutter, Cream City Review, Poetry Ireland and many more. Alongside multiple professional accreditations in conflict mediation, &amp;Oacute; Tuama holds a BA and MTh in Theology, and is a current PhD candidate in the School of Critical Studies at the University of Glasgow, exploring poetry and prayer under the supervision of Prof Heather Walton and Dr Samuel Tongue.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please register on Eventbrite here:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=""https://poetrylab.eventbrite.com"" target=""_blank""&gt;https://poetrylab.eventbrite.com&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","","2022-01-26 01:43:50","X-BEDEWORK-REGISTRATION-GUEST-ACCESS : values : text : 	email,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Type/Webcast,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Type/Workshop,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Events open to/Alumni,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Events open to/Faculty,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Events open to/Graduate Students,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Events open to/Postdocs,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Events open to/Prospective Students,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Events open to/Public,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Events open to/Staff,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Events open to/Student,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Events open to/Trainees,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Category/Arts,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Category/Earth Institute,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Category/Humanities,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Category/International and Public Affairs,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Category/Other,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Category/Social Justice,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Location/Online,X-BEDEWORK-SHORTTITLE : values : text : Poetry Lab: Exploring Conflict Intelligence through a Poem,X-BEDEWORK-SUBMITTEDBY : values : text : ak3915 for Columbia Climate School (agrp_CCS),X-BEDEWORK-CUSTOM-URL-LABEL : values : text : Click here to register on Eventbrite,X-BEDEWORK-DESCRIPTION-FORMAT : values : text : html,X-BEDEWORK-CALSUITE : values : text : Columbia Climate School"

The disparity between Poland and several Western countries, first noted in the 1980s, was repeatedly associated with the different gender politics in the capitalist West and (post)state socialist East. The talk will examine this explanation to show how the ratio was employed as a comparative and ultimately normative tool. Janion hopes to elucidate the interrelations between (trans)sexuality and anxieties over European geopolitics in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Ways to Attend&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_eyaQ-keTQXmqjUhA3FWBuA"" target=""_blank""&gt;Register for Zoom Webinar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/lY66By3JshE"" target=""_blank""&gt;Watch on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","","2022-02-28 20:51:03","X-BEDEWORK-REGISTRATION-GUEST-ACCESS : values : text : 	email,X-BEDEWORK-IMAGE : values : text : /public/images/ratio picture annie-spratt-unsplash-202202101108.jpg,X-BEDEWORK-THUMB-IMAGE : values : text : 	/public/images/ratio picture annie-spratt-unsplash-202202101108-thumb.png,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Location/Online,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Type/Lecture,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Alumni,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Faculty,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Family Friendly,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Graduate Students,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Postdocs,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Prospective Students,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Public,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Staff,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Student,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Trainees,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Category/International and Public Affairs,X-BEDEWORK-SUBMITTEDBY : values : text : pb2855 for SIPA_HarrimanInstitute (agrp_SIPA_HarrimanInstitute),X-BEDEWORK-CUSTOM-URL-LABEL : values : text : For more information, please visit the Harriman Institute website,X-BEDEWORK-DESCRIPTION-FORMAT : values : text : html,X-BEDEWORK-CALSUITE : values : text : SIPA - Harriman Institute,X-BEDEWORK-SHORTTITLE : values : text : Transsexuality and Gender Ratio in Poland: East/West Dichotomy"

In our system, CO2 removal is a byproduct of wastewater treatment, enables recovery of valuable raw material, and serves as a cost-reduction. Analogous to a thermodynamic chemical system, CO2 sequestration becomes economically &amp;quot;spontaneous&amp;quot;, and its scale directly couples with demand for essential raw materials. Thus, it becomes possible to build scaled CO2 removal into core industrial operations. Functionally, our system represents a negative point source emission of CO2. This talk will present the basic concept we&amp;#39;re employing, its basis in carbon cycling and established CO2 removal strategies, and how the system interfaces with the environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nMichael Long founded Renaissance Fiber in 2018 in response to loosening of restrictions on cultivation of industrial hemp in the US. Renaissance Fiber seeks to produce clean natural materials from hemp for textiles and other industries. Prior to founding Renaissance Fiber, Michael was a post-doc and research associate at Harvard University&amp;#39;s John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, focusing on atmospheric and ocean chemistry and physics. He has a B.S. in Meterology from N.C.

It is classically dipped in either peanut sauce, fish sauce, or hoisin sauce. Contrary to popular belief, this dish originates from Vietnam and not China.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;APAMSA is especially interested in providing AAPI students with this hands-on opportunity to engage in Vietnamese food and culture due to the organization&amp;rsquo;s relative lack of Southeast Asian representation in the past. Increasing representation of Southeast Asian culture in APAMSA events is one of the current board&amp;rsquo;s biggest goals this year (as well as South Asian culture). This issue also extends far beyond our organization, as educational and economic disparities amongst Southeast Asian Americans are often overlooked. These educational disparities are particularly apparent in medicine, and in the VP&amp;amp;S M1 class there are no fully Southeast Asian students at all. Asian Americans are extremely diverse yet are often grouped together with East Asians viewed as the prototype &amp;ndash; not just by non-AAPI individuals, but also by many Asian Americans too. With this in mind, it is crucial for APAMSA to diversify events and educate students about Southeast Asian culture.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Board members would prepare fresh ingredients beforehand and split them into containers for each table. Instructions for making the spring roll would be displayed on the classroom&amp;rsquo;s large screen. Attendees would be informed about masking guidelines and told to wash their hands, then they would be able to make their own spring rolls and eat them with dipping sauces we will provide. Dietary restrictions would be assessed via RSVP form and different ingredients/dipping options provided accordingly. We want to cap the attendance at 30 students, but depending on COVID gathering guidelines at the time, we can adjust this number accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;","","2022-02-11 20:35:27","X-BEDEWORK-REGISTRATION-GUEST-ACCESS : values : text : 	email,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-cumc_pandsclub/Location/Medical Center,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-cumc_pandsclub/Type/Community,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-cumc_pandsclub/Type/Cultural,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-cumc_pandsclub/Events open to/Graduate Students,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-cumc_pandsclub/Category/College of Physicians and Surgeons,X-BEDEWORK-SHORTTITLE : values : text : Vietnamese Spring Roll Night,X-BEDEWORK-SUBMITTEDBY : values : text : cr3139 for CUMC - PandS Club (agrp_cumc_psclub),X-BEDEWORK-DESCRIPTION-FORMAT : values : text : html,X-BEDEWORK-CALSUITE : values : text : CUMC - PandS Club"

This framework (necessarily) results in empirical tradeoffs (Pareto frontiers) between fairness and accuracy that can be chosen by stakeholders. After surveying these developments, I will describe an alternative approach inspired by the concept of &amp;ldquo;bias bounties&amp;rdquo; that manages to sidestep such tradeoffs.

During the twentieth century, Iranian Jews experienced rapid upward mobility, migrated within the country and abroad, participated in significant political and social movements, and integrated into several layers of Iranian society. This talk will explore the landscape of Jewish identity in Iran during the 20th century, with a special focus on Jewish-Muslim interactions, political engagement and aspirations, and the intersection of education and integration. As we examine how Iranian Jews navigated between their Iranian and Jewish identities in an era of new nationalisms, we gain insight into what Jewish emancipation and assimilation looked like in a Muslim-majority country. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Daniella Farah &lt;/strong&gt;is a 2021-2023 Samuel W. and Goldye Marian Spain Postdoctoral Fellow in Jewish Studies at Rice University. She received her PhD in Jewish History from Stanford University in July 2021. Dr. Farah&amp;rsquo;s scholarship, which lies at the intersection of Jewish history, Middle Eastern history, education history, and transnational studies, examines interreligious encounters, national belonging, and Jewish identity formation in modern Iran and Turkey. As an Iranian-American Jewish woman, her work aims to give voice to Middle Eastern Jews&amp;rsquo; experiences. Her article, &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;The school is the link between the Jewish community and the surrounding milieu&amp;rsquo;: Education and the Jews of Iran from the mid-1940s to the late 1960s,&amp;rdquo; was published in 2021 in the journal of &lt;em&gt;Middle Eastern Studies&lt;/em&gt;.

Shevchenko in forging Ukrainian identity, it is important that his legacy as an artist (and first and foremost, as a poet) should not be the exclusive property of Shevchenko scholars and, worst of all, ideologues of different shapes and stripes. To turn a poet into an icon or a monument would have a very detrimental effect on anything he stands for, and on the whole Ukrainian national project. And that is why each generation of Ukrainians should have a fresh look at his life and his works. It is not only their right, it is their duty. And the basic questions they have to address are: Is he really a good poet? Does his life and work justify his status as a father figure of a modern nation? Does his writing still resonate with us? The book &amp;ldquo;Свіжим оком. Шевченко для сучасного читача&amp;rdquo; (Rereading Taras Shevchenko) tries to tackle all these issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The book is written from a perspective of a contemporary Ukrainian reader, properly educated, open-minded and neither politically, nor ideologically motivated. Thematically, the book discusses such issues as Ukrainian romanticism, the role of folklore, the predominance of emotions in the Bard&amp;rsquo;s poetry, Christianity and Paganism, the theme of Empire, his attitude towards Cossacks, his nearly metaphysical loneliness, the absence of Ukrainian literary infrastructure, as well as Shevchenko&amp;rsquo;s messianic aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Ways to Attend&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_6nI4rSaMTyuwDTG-Dw0Y1g"" target=""_blank""&gt;Register for Zoom Webinar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/Ikt_enXLiAI"" target=""_blank""&gt;Watch on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","","2022-02-04 15:39:31","X-BEDEWORK-REGISTRATION-GUEST-ACCESS : values : text : 	email,X-BEDEWORK-IMAGE : values : text : /public/images/2021-03-09 Volodymyr Dibrova Ukrainian 4x3-202202031110.png,X-BEDEWORK-THUMB-IMAGE : values : text : 	/public/images/2021-03-09 Volodymyr Dibrova Ukrainian 4x3-202202031110-thumb.png,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Location/Online,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Type/Discussion,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Alumni,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Faculty,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Family Friendly,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Graduate Students,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Postdocs,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Prospective Students,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Public,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Staff,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Student,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Trainees,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Category/International and Public Affairs,X-BEDEWORK-SHORTTITLE : values : text : Do We Need Another Book on Taras Shevchenko?,X-BEDEWORK-SUBMITTEDBY : values : text : pb2855 for SIPA_HarrimanInstitute (agrp_SIPA_HarrimanInstitute),X-BEDEWORK-CUSTOM-URL-LABEL : values : text : For more information, please visit the Harriman Institute website,X-BEDEWORK-DESCRIPTION-FORMAT : values : text : html,X-BEDEWORK-CALSUITE : values : text : SIPA - Harriman Institute"

We also prioritize a practitioner&amp;rsquo;s perspective, using Brazil as a reference to discuss challenges that developing nations face in their development path.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The seminar welcomes those who may be learning about Brazil for the first time as well as those who are already well acquainted with its people, society, and culture and wish to delve deeper into particular research areas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;","","2022-03-04 18:30:55","X-BEDEWORK-REGISTRATION-GUEST-ACCESS : values : text : 	email,X-BEDEWORK-IMAGE : values : text : /public/images/Brazil Seminar Series-202202250330.jpg,X-BEDEWORK-THUMB-IMAGE : values : text : 	/public/images/Brazil Seminar Series-202202250330-thumb.png,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Location/Online,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Type/Seminar,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Events open to/Alumni,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Events open to/Faculty,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Events open to/Graduate Students,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Events open to/Postdocs,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Events open to/Prospective Students,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Events open to/Public,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Events open to/Staff,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Events open to/Student,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Events open to/Trainees,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Category/Finance,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Category/Economics,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Category/International and Public Affairs,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Group-Specific/Latin America,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-ilas/Group-Specific/Brazil,X-BEDEWORK-SUBMITTEDBY : values : text : cgf2118 for ILAS (agrp_ilas),X-BEDEWORK-DESCRIPTION-FORMAT : values : text : html,X-BEDEWORK-CALSUITE : values : text : ILAS,X-BEDEWORK-SHORTTITLE : values : text : Brazil Seminar: Freedom of Speech &amp; Democracy in Times of Fake News"

Translator &lt;strong&gt;Branislav Jakovljević&lt;/strong&gt; (Stanford University) will be joined by discussant &lt;strong&gt;Branka Arsić&lt;/strong&gt; (Columbia University) and moderators &lt;strong&gt;Aleksandar Bo&amp;scaron;ković&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Christopher Caes&lt;/strong&gt;, ECEC co-directors.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Philosophy of Parochialism&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is Radomir Konstantinović&amp;rsquo;s (1928&amp;ndash;2011) most celebrated and reviled book. First published in Belgrade as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Filosofija palanke&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;in 1969, it attracted keen attention and controversy through its unsparing critique of Serbian and any other nationalism in Yugoslavia and beyond. The book was prophetic, seeming to anticipate not only the bloody disintegration of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, but also the totalitarian turn in politics across the globe in the first decades of the new century. With this translation, English-speaking audiences can at last discover one of the most original writers of eastern European late modernism, and gain an important and original perspective into contemporary politics and culture in the West and beyond. This is a book that seems to age in reverse, as its meanings become deeper and more universal with the passage of time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Konstantinović&amp;rsquo;s&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;book&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;resists easy classification, mixing classical, Montaigne-like essay, prose poetry, novel, and literary history. The word &amp;ldquo;philosophy&amp;rdquo; in the book&amp;rsquo;s title refers to the solitary activity of reflection and critical thinking, and is also paradoxical: according to the author, a defining characteristic of parochialism is precisely its intolerance toward this kind of self-reflexivity. In Konstantinović&amp;rsquo;s analysis, parochialism is not a simply a characteristic of a geographical region or a cultural, political, and historical formation&amp;mdash;these are all just manifestations of the parochial spirit as the spirit of insularity. His book illuminates the current moment, in which insularity undergirds not only ethnic and national divisions, but also dictates the very structure of everyday life, and where individuals can easily find themselves locked in an echo chamber of social media.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Philosophy of Parochialism&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;can help us understand better not only the dead ends of ethnic nationalism and other atavistic ideologies, but also of those cultural forces such as digital technologies that have been built on the promise of overcoming those ideologies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Ways to Attend&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_6gZ5zmF-RlqRYNtk-RjjFQ"" target=""_blank""&gt;Register for Zoom Webinar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/VJrEapj4DUw"" target=""_blank""&gt;Watch on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In-person (CUID Only):&lt;strong&gt; Reserve Your Seat&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(see button below)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;","","2022-03-03 02:17:31","X-BEDEWORK-WAIT-LIST-LIMIT : values : text : 	0,X-BEDEWORK-REGISTRATION-START : values : text : 20220208T000000,X-BEDEWORK-UNI-ONLY-REG : values : text : 	YES,X-BEDEWORK-IMAGE : values : text : /public/images/2022-02-22 ECEC Book Talk 4x3-202202080439.png,X-BEDEWORK-REGISTRATION-END : values : text : 20220309T193000,X-BEDEWORK-THUMB-IMAGE : values : text : 	/public/images/2022-02-22 ECEC Book Talk 4x3-202202080439-thumb.png,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Type/Lecture,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Alumni,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Faculty,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Family Friendly,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Graduate Students,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Postdocs,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Prospective Students,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Public,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Staff,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Student,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Trainees,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Category/International and Public Affairs,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Location/Morningside,X-BEDEWORK-MAX-TICKETS-PER-USER : values : text : 	1,X-BEDEWORK-MAX-TICKETS : values : text : 	100,X-BEDEWORK-SUBMITTEDBY : values : text : pb2855 for SIPA_HarrimanInstitute (agrp_SIPA_HarrimanInstitute),X-BEDEWORK-CUSTOM-URL-LABEL : values : text : For more information, please visit the Harriman Institute website,X-BEDEWORK-DESCRIPTION-FORMAT : values : text : html,X-BEDEWORK-CALSUITE : values : text : SIPA - Harriman Institute,X-BEDEWORK-REG-BUTTON-TEXT : values : text : Reserve Your Seat,X-BEDEWORK-SHORTTITLE : values : text : Radomir Konstantinović's ""The Philosophy of Parochialism"""

After COVID-19 confines Helena in Puyo &amp;mdash; the closest city to Sarayaku &amp;mdash; she learns that 80% of her community has been infected with the virus, and that the Bobonaza River has flooded part of her village.

A growing body of evidence shows that the interactions of intrinsic and extrinsic factors, across length scales from molecules to organisms, contribute to the rates of ageing and age-associated diseases in humans. However, it is unclear how underlying molecular states of an individual relate to their clinical outlook. We postulate that studying age-associated changes at intermediate length scales of cells may provide a key link to understand ageing patterns. As integrators of molecular signals, cells offer a sensitive meso-scale view of ageing, with cellular dysfunctions likely occurring prior to the manifestation of age-associated diseases. In the seminar, I will present: how biophysical properties of cells constitute a framework to study ageing, the role of cellular heterogeneity in propagating ageing phenotypes, and a generalizable framework to understand emergent patterns of single-cell motility with applications for healthy ageing and disease.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT THE SPEAKER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jude Phillip, Ph.D.&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, and Oncology; Core Member,&amp;nbsp;Institute for Nanobiotechnology (INBT), Johns Hopkins University&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jude Phillip is an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering, with secondary appointments in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Oncology, and is a core member in the Institute for Nanobiotechnology (INBT) at Johns Hopkins University. He completed his B.Eng. in Chemical Engineering at CCNY, a PhD in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, and postdoctoral training at Weill Cornell Medicine. At Johns Hopkins his lab studies biological ageing dynamics in health and disease.

Large velocities and high melt rates are thought to occur adjacent to highly turbulent subglacial discharge plumes. However, recent observations demonstrate that melt rates are also high far away from plumes, suggesting that other ocean processes may facilitate heat and salt fluxes to the ice-ocean interface. Using extensive in situ observations, as well as idealised large eddy simulations, we demonstrate that the subglacial discharge plume emanating from LeConte Glacier, Alaska, generates an energetic internal gravity wave field. The waves are persistent in time and fill the near-glacier fjord, accounting for ~ 50 % of the total observed kinetic energy near the ice-ocean boundary during the two-week September 2018 field campaign. They are characterised by coherent oscillations in velocity of magnitude 1 - 8 cm/s with a period of ~ 10 mins (close to the local buoyancy period) and a horizontal wavelength of 150 - 200 m. The signal was identified in two separate mooring records, one of which was located within 100 m of the terminus, suggesting that internal waves have the potential to enhance melting by driving flow directly at the ice-ocean interface. Accounting for wave velocities within a commonly used melt parameterisation, which assumes shear-driven boundary layer dynamics, results in a 40 - 80 % increase in the estimated melt rate relative to ambient (no wave) conditions.,X-BEDEWORK-DESCRIPTION-FORMAT : values : text : html"

The all-out attack on Ukraine&amp;rsquo;s existence begun on February 24th has further challenged these artists to respond creatively and to ensure the country&amp;rsquo;s survival.

Equally comfortable expounding on the American soul to a group of schoolkids as he is with the minutiae of city government, Wolberg&amp;rsquo;s public face hides some disturbing private troubles: at home he&amp;rsquo;s increasingly estranged from his wife, and his two teenage children don&amp;rsquo;t get him&amp;mdash;nor he they. As the emotional fault lines that surround the good mayor begin to split apart around the time of his daughter&amp;rsquo;s 18th birthday, Simon must struggle to hold his family together. The wonderful ensemble cast includes a scene-stealing Bozon as Wolberg&amp;rsquo;s brother-in-law and constant headache.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This masterclass with Axelle Ropert will be introduced and moderated by Shanny Peer, Director of the Columbia Maison Fran&amp;ccedil;aise.

At poetry&amp;rsquo;s heart can be ambivalence, rage, lament, resistance, regression, the murky world of dreams, and anxiety. In this way, poetry is primed to provide interest into the human animal&amp;rsquo;s behavior during times of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The outcome of P&amp;aacute;draig &amp;Oacute; Tuama&amp;#39;s residency at Columbia will be a publication that will pair 35 poems with insight about conflict - connecting them with major themes expressed in the award-winning&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Handbook of Conflict Resolution: Theory and Practice&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(2014). This includes conflict between individuals; conflict in groups; ambivalent responses to conflict; regression, aggression, and resistance; cooperation and negotiation; as well as conflict as a state of existence in the current climate crisis. Ground Rules will explore what it means to be grounded in human emotion, in physical space, in historical and post-colonial contexts, and in collaboration with each other for the purpose of moving towards flourishing and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;P&amp;aacute;draig &amp;Oacute; Tuama presents&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Poetry Unbound&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;from&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;On Being&lt;/em&gt;, a podcast that began in early 2020. Just about to start its fourth season in the Fall of 2021, this podcast has already exceeded six million downloads. A book from the podcast is forthcoming (October 2021) from WW Norton.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;P&amp;aacute;draig &amp;Oacute; Tuama&amp;rsquo;s published work includes poetry (Readings from the Book of Exile, Sorry for your Troubles, Canterbury Press 2012 and 2013), Theology (Daily Prayer and Borders and Belonging; Canterbury Press 2017 and 2021) and memoir In the Shelter (Broadleaf Books, 2021). A former leader of Corrymeela, Ireland&amp;rsquo;s oldest peace organisation, he combines interest in language, religion and conflict in all his written work. A frequent guest on long-form radio, his interviews have been featured on national broadcasters in Ireland, the UK, the USA, Australia and New Zealand. His poems have been published in the Harvard Review, Gutter, Cream City Review, Poetry Ireland and many more. Alongside multiple professional accreditations in conflict mediation, &amp;Oacute; Tuama holds a BA and MTh in Theology, and is a current PhD candidate in the School of Critical Studies at the University of Glasgow, exploring poetry and prayer under the supervision of Prof Heather Walton and Dr Samuel Tongue.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please register on Eventbrite here:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=""https://poetrylab.eventbrite.com"" target=""_blank""&gt;https://poetrylab.eventbrite.com&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","","2022-01-26 01:43:50","X-BEDEWORK-REGISTRATION-GUEST-ACCESS : values : text : 	email,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Type/Webcast,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Type/Workshop,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Events open to/Alumni,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Events open to/Faculty,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Events open to/Graduate Students,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Events open to/Postdocs,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Events open to/Prospective Students,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Events open to/Public,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Events open to/Staff,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Events open to/Student,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Events open to/Trainees,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Category/Arts,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Category/Earth Institute,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Category/Humanities,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Category/International and Public Affairs,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Category/Other,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Category/Social Justice,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-CCS/Location/Online,X-BEDEWORK-SHORTTITLE : values : text : Poetry Lab: Exploring Conflict Intelligence through a Poem,X-BEDEWORK-SUBMITTEDBY : values : text : ak3915 for Columbia Climate School (agrp_CCS),X-BEDEWORK-CUSTOM-URL-LABEL : values : text : Click here to register on Eventbrite,X-BEDEWORK-DESCRIPTION-FORMAT : values : text : html,X-BEDEWORK-CALSUITE : values : text : Columbia Climate School"

In this event, Page Knox, Ph.D., Lecturer in Art History and Archaeology, will examine American Art in a Global Context through an examination of painting, sculpture, decorative arts, photography, fashion, and visual culture in the United States from 1750 to 1914. The class will also consider how American art participated in the revolutions and reforms of the nineteenth century, and how events of the period continue to impact the U.S. today.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Page Knox is an adjunct professor in the Art History Department of Columbia University, where she received her Ph.D. in 2012. She works contractually in a variety of capacities at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, giving public gallery talks and lectures in special exhibitions as well as the permanent collection, teaching classes at the museum, and leading groups for Travel with the Met.&amp;nbsp;She is a contributing author for a recently released textbook on the History of Illustration. Knox also teaches summer courses at Columbia that focus on American Art and Trans-Atlantic Exchange during the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Representatives from the Columbia University Summer Session and from the Admissions team will also be available to answer questions about how students may apply and enroll as visiting or current Columbia students.&lt;/p&gt;","","2022-03-07 14:37:35","X-BEDEWORK-REGISTRATION-GUEST-ACCESS : values : text : 	email,X-BEDEWORK-IMAGE : values : text : /public/images/22SS040_EC-03-15_SM_1200x675_v01-202203041122.png,X-BEDEWORK-THUMB-IMAGE : values : text : 	/public/images/22SS040_EC-03-15_SM_1200x675_v01-202203041122-thumb.png,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-sps/Location/Online,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-sps/Type/Course,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-sps/Type/Lecture,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-sps/Type/Information Session,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-sps/Events open to/Alumni,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-sps/Events open to/Faculty,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-sps/Events open to/Family Friendly,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-sps/Events open to/Graduate Students,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-sps/Events open to/Postdocs,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-sps/Events open to/Prospective Students,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-sps/Events open to/Public,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-sps/Events open to/Staff,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-sps/Events open to/Student,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-sps/Events open to/Trainees,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-sps/Category/Arts,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-sps/Category/Other,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-sps/Category/Admissions,X-BEDEWORK-SHORTTITLE : values : text : Columbia Summer Session Preview: American Art in a Global Context,X-BEDEWORK-SUBMITTEDBY : values : text : ks2822 for SPS (agrp_sps),X-BEDEWORK-DESCRIPTION-FORMAT : values : text : html,X-BEDEWORK-CALSUITE : values : text : SPS"

However, collection of this vast trove of multimodal data comes with daunting challenges in the analysis and privacy spaces. In this talk, I will first describe how computational modeling and statistical mechanics can help interpret gene regulatory mechanisms from omics measurements such as from ChIP-seq and Hi-C data. I will then describe what kind of patient privacy risks that the analysis and sharing of these measurements pose and how we can mitigate these risks using computational techniques.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://columbiacuimc.zoom.us/j/99904306839?pwd=TVJ3VGV0K2hOdlpjRFdIYjd2Sk5MUT09"" target=""_blank""&gt;JOIN ZOOM MEETING&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Meeting ID: 999 0430 6839&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Passcode: seminar&lt;/p&gt;","","2022-02-14 19:46:16","X-BEDEWORK-REGISTRATION-GUEST-ACCESS : values : text : 	email,X-BEDEWORK-IMAGE : values : text : /public/images/Screen Shot 2022-02-13 at 9.33.19 AM-202202130950.png,X-BEDEWORK-THUMB-IMAGE : values : text : 	/public/images/Screen Shot 2022-02-13 at 9.33.19 AM-202202130950-thumb.png,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-hiccc/Location/Online,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-hiccc/Category/Basic Health Sciences,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-hiccc/Category/Clinical Health Sciences,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-hiccc/Category/College of Physicians and Surgeons,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-hiccc/Category/Computer Science,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-hiccc/Category/Healthcare,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-hiccc/Category/Research,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-hiccc/Type/Seminar,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-hiccc/Events open to/Alumni,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-hiccc/Events open to/Faculty,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-hiccc/Events open to/Family Friendly,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-hiccc/Events open to/Graduate Students,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-hiccc/Events open to/Postdocs,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-hiccc/Events open to/Prospective Students,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-hiccc/Events open to/Public,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-hiccc/Events open to/Staff,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-hiccc/Events open to/Student,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-hiccc/Events open to/Trainees,X-BEDEWORK-SHORTTITLE : values : text : HICCC Research-in-Progress Seminar,X-BEDEWORK-SUBMITTEDBY : values : text : sgf2 for Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (agrp_hiccc),X-BEDEWORK-DESCRIPTION-FORMAT : values : text : html,X-BEDEWORK-CALSUITE : values : text : Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center"

The cell composition of a tumor at any time point is the result of multiple dynamic cellular processes, including tumor-derived cell differentiation processes, paracrine communication between tumor cells and the microenvironment, and evolution from selective pressure and clonal competition. The application of concepts from metric geometry to the study of tumor configuration spaces provides a natural mathematical framework for making inferences about these continuous and dynamic cellular processes. In this talk, I will present a geometric approach for estimating dynamic cell abundances from gene expression data of bulk tissues using single-cell RNA-seq datasets as a reference. I will then illustrate the utility of this analytic approach with its application to the study of the drivers of mesenchymal transformation in pediatric ependymoma, a rare but devastating type of glioma in children.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio: &lt;/strong&gt;Pablo G. C&amp;aacute;mara, Ph.D. is an Assistant Professor of Genetics at the University of Pennsylvania, Perelman School of Medicine, and a member of the Penn Institute for Biomedical Informatics and the Center for Artificial Intelligence and Data Science for Integrated Diagnostics. He received a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics from Universidad Autonoma de Madrid and performed research in this field for several years. Fascinated by the interesting and fundamental open questions in biology, in 2014 he shifted his research focus into quantitative biology. His current research utilizes principles of mathematics to address some of the problems that the complexity and scale of biological data pose to traditional computational methods. Drawing ideas from topology, geometry, statistics, physics, and computer science, and making use of high-throughput single-cell technologies and large-scale population studies, his group aims to achieve a more complete understanding of the cellular composition and signaling networks of tumors in relation to their genetics.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;","","2022-02-21 19:52:51","X-BEDEWORK-REGISTRATION-GUEST-ACCESS : values : text : 	email,X-BEDEWORK-IMAGE : values : text : /public/images/IICD Seminar Series_Announcement_Twitter-202110180300.png,X-BEDEWORK-THUMB-IMAGE : values : text : 	/public/images/IICD Seminar Series_Announcement_Twitter-202110180300-thumb.png,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-IICD/Type/Lecture,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-IICD/Type/Seminar,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-IICD/Events open to/Alumni,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-IICD/Events open to/Faculty,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-IICD/Events open to/Graduate Students,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-IICD/Events open to/Postdocs,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-IICD/Events open to/Prospective Students,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-IICD/Events open to/Public,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-IICD/Events open to/Staff,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-IICD/Events open to/Student,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-IICD/Events open to/Trainees,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-IICD/Category/Research,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-IICD/Location/Morningside,X-BEDEWORK-SUBMITTEDBY : values : text : lf2724 for IICD Events (agrp_IICD),X-BEDEWORK-DESCRIPTION-FORMAT : values : text : html,X-BEDEWORK-CALSUITE : values : text : IICD Events,X-BEDEWORK-SHORTTITLE : values : text : IICD Seminar Series: Pablo G.

Large velocities and high melt rates are thought to occur adjacent to highly turbulent subglacial discharge plumes. However, recent observations demonstrate that melt rates are also high far away from plumes, suggesting that other ocean processes may facilitate heat and salt fluxes to the ice-ocean interface. Using extensive in situ observations, as well as idealised large eddy simulations, we demonstrate that the subglacial discharge plume emanating from LeConte Glacier, Alaska, generates an energetic internal gravity wave field. The waves are persistent in time and fill the near-glacier fjord, accounting for ~ 50 % of the total observed kinetic energy near the ice-ocean boundary during the two-week September 2018 field campaign. They are characterised by coherent oscillations in velocity of magnitude 1 - 8 cm/s with a period of ~ 10 mins (close to the local buoyancy period) and a horizontal wavelength of 150 - 200 m. The signal was identified in two separate mooring records, one of which was located within 100 m of the terminus, suggesting that internal waves have the potential to enhance melting by driving flow directly at the ice-ocean interface. Accounting for wave velocities within a commonly used melt parameterisation, which assumes shear-driven boundary layer dynamics, results in a 40 - 80 % increase in the estimated melt rate relative to ambient (no wave) conditions.,X-BEDEWORK-DESCRIPTION-FORMAT : values : text : html"

Studies abound regarding the disproportionate impacts and effects of mass incarceration, police brutality, and income inequality, to name a few, among black and brown populations in both countries. Despite these similarities, the demographic makeup of these two nations could not be more different: while roughly 55% of Brazil&amp;acute;s population identifies as black or mixed race, approximately 12% of Americans identify as black. What can a comparative look at these countries teach us about the consequences of structural racism and about potential solutions to eradicate racism from our societies?&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nSpeakers:&lt;br /&gt;\nDavid Williams, Florence Sprague Norman and Laura Smart Norman Professor of Public Health; Chair, Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Harvard T.H.

The results can charitably be described as mixed. The &amp;ldquo;other than the Baltic States&amp;rdquo; mantra notwithstanding, in the rest of the region these efforts have led to a handful of democratic breakthroughs, no meaningful democratic consolidation, widespread frustration and a recognition that the work is much more complex than initially thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This panel will bring together practitioners, scholars and other relevant actors to reflect on the impact of the democracy promotion project in the region. The discussion will explore the work of democracy promotion, what it got right, what it got wrong and what the future might hold.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Democracy promotion has been a key thematic understanding of US foreign policy globally, but particularly in this region. This panel will provide an opportunity to discuss and think about these questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Speakers&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah Bush&lt;/strong&gt;, Associate Professor of Political Science at Yale University&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom Carothers&lt;/strong&gt;, Senior Vice President for Studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard Miles,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;US Ambassador to Georgia, retired&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moderator:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Lincoln Mitchell&lt;/strong&gt;, political analyst and former Harriman Institute Associate who has published extensively on this topic&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Ways to Attend&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_iOzsQSSeT4maXMm3hzkdSQ"" target=""_blank""&gt;Register for Zoom Webinar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/XfabB14mia0"" target=""_blank""&gt;Watch on YouTube&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","","2022-03-22 15:15:42","X-BEDEWORK-REGISTRATION-GUEST-ACCESS : values : text : 	email,X-BEDEWORK-IMAGE : values : text : /public/images/BEDEWORK 2022-03-22 Democracy Promotion Panel-202203210912.png,X-BEDEWORK-THUMB-IMAGE : values : text : 	/public/images/BEDEWORK 2022-03-22 Democracy Promotion Panel-202203210912-thumb.png,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Location/Online,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Type/Panel,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Alumni,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Faculty,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Family Friendly,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Graduate Students,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Postdocs,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Prospective Students,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Public,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Staff,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Student,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Trainees,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Category/International and Public Affairs,X-BEDEWORK-SHORTTITLE : values : text : Looking Back on Thirty Years of Democracy Promotion in the Region,X-BEDEWORK-SUBMITTEDBY : values : text : pb2855 for SIPA_HarrimanInstitute (agrp_SIPA_HarrimanInstitute),X-BEDEWORK-CUSTOM-URL-LABEL : values : text : For more information, please visit the Harriman Institute website,X-BEDEWORK-DESCRIPTION-FORMAT : values : text : html,X-BEDEWORK-CALSUITE : values : text : SIPA - Harriman Institute"

The fourth webinar in the New Utopias Series will bring together experts from the U.S. and E.U to analyze the emerging causes of poverty and explore ways to address the needs of vulnerable populations. How have the causes of poverty, and our understanding of them, developed over time? What have been the results of basic income policies in the U.S. and E.U.? What does current data tell us about the efficacy of a Universal Basic Income? Is poverty eradication a realizable goal?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;New Utopias is a series of panel discussions on the world to come presented by Columbia Global Centers | Paris, the Alliance Program, and the European Institute.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_a1Coguu-SIK0kWSm15KmYg"" target=""_blank""&gt;REGISTER&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISCUSSANTS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fran&amp;ccedil;ois Bourguignon&lt;/strong&gt; is Director of Studies at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales.

Focusing on disasters, climate and development initiatives carried out in collaboration with Columbia&amp;rsquo;s climate experts and other partners, we will share recent innovations in how to engage in serious-yet-fun, fruitful conversations about what we know and what we can do. We will enjoy &lt;em&gt;Games&lt;/em&gt; that help people and organizations experience the complexity of future risks and tough decisions, as well as tailor-made &lt;em&gt;Humor&lt;/em&gt; (including a live cartoonist co-creating original work with participants!), and our most recent exploration: &lt;em&gt;Thermochromic Art&lt;/em&gt; (paintings using a special pigment that changes attributes when temperature exceeds a certain threshold). Building on examples from rural Kenya to the White House&amp;nbsp;and from the Vatican to Nasa, we will jointly brainstorm: how can researchers, artists and designers work with you, government, &amp;nbsp;humanitarian and development organizations?&amp;nbsp; Given evolving hazards and vulnerabilities, let&amp;rsquo;s chart the way forward to mobilize both the intellect and the emotions of decision makers at all scales.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Pablo Suarez&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;innovation lead at the Red Cross Red&amp;nbsp;Crescent Climate Centre,&amp;nbsp;as well as&amp;nbsp;visiting fellow at&amp;nbsp;Boston University, and&amp;nbsp;artist in residence at the National University of Singapore.&amp;nbsp;He has consulted for the United Nations&amp;nbsp;Development Programme, the World Food Programme, World Bank,&amp;nbsp;Oxfam,&amp;nbsp;and about twenty other international humanitarian and development&amp;nbsp;organizations, working in more than 60 countries.&amp;nbsp;A consistently original and engaging communicator, his current&amp;nbsp;work involves creative approaches to risk management &amp;ndash; ranging from financial instruments for faster disaster preparedness, to self-learning algorithms for flood prediction, to collaboration with professional humorists to inspire thinking and action. Pablo holds a water engineering degree, a master&amp;rsquo;s degree in planning,&amp;nbsp;and a Ph.D. in geography.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The program will run from 4pm-5pm, with a reception to follow from 5pm-6pm.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This event is open to CUID holders.

These included a series of export controls and the sanctioning of the Russian Central Bank, major institutions in the financial sector as well as individual &amp;ldquo;oligarchs&amp;rdquo; who live and conduct business outside of the country. In addition to these government actions by the United States, the European Union and the UK, hundreds of Western private companies have withdrawn from the Russian market or suspended operations, further exacerbating Russian economic uncertainty.

Conveying empathy in human-human interaction as well as conversational systems can encourage users to like a speaker more, to believe the speaker is more intelligent, to actually take the speaker&amp;rsquo;s advice, to want to speak with the speaker longer and more often, to like the speaker and to trust it more. It can also be used to improve success in health-care advice-giving, as well as in negotiations and conflict resolution. Much research has been done in the past 20 years on creating responses that can convey empathy to one&amp;rsquo;s conversational partners in text, facial expression and gesture in conversational systems. However very little has been done to identify the speech features that can create an empathetic sounding voice. In this talk I will discuss some prior research on the importance of empathy in conversation as well as current, ongoing work in our lab on identifying acoustic-prosodic as well as lexical features characterizing empathetic speech, and how these features can be used to create empathetic voices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julia Hirschberg&lt;/strong&gt; is Percy K. and Vida L. W. Hudson Professor of Computer Science at Columbia University (department chair from 2012-2018). &amp;nbsp;She previously worked at Bell Laboratories and AT&amp;amp;T Labs on text-to-speech synthesis (TTs) and then created the first HCI Research Department. &amp;nbsp; She has served on the ACL executive board, the ISCA board (2005-7 as president), the CRA-WP board, the NAACL executive board, the CRA Executive Board, the AAAI Council, and the IEEE SLTC as well as numerous awards committees. &amp;nbsp;She was editor of Computational Linguistics and Speech Communication and is a fellow of AAAI, ISCA, ACL, ACM, and IEEE, and a member of the NAE, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society. &amp;nbsp;She received the IEEE James L. Flanagan Speech and Audio Processing Award, the ISCA Medal for Scientific Achievement and the ISCA Special Service Medal. She has worked for diversity for many years at AT&amp;amp;T and Columbia. She studies speech and NLP, currently TTS, false information on social media and its intent, multimodal humor, radicalization in videos, and deceptive, trusted, emotional, charismatic, and empathetic, speech.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.eventbrite.com/e/conveying-empathy-in-conversation-tickets-268953616507?aff=bedework"" target=""_blank""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Register here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The CAIT Distinguished Lecture Series seeks to promote education and learning on the state of artificial intelligence technology through lectures from both academic and industry researchers and experts.

What does not or does not yet exist plays a predominant role in science and technology. What do scientists look for and how does their way of searching influence what they find? The antechamber of discovery is not as, as is frequently thought, an inscrutable &amp;ldquo;private art&amp;rdquo; marked by a punctual &amp;ldquo;Eureka!&amp;rdquo; moment. It is a rich cultural, social, economic and political space where sought-after imaginary perpetrators have recognizable characteristics that have remained fairly constant throughout many centuries.

Moderated by&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Aleksandar Bo&amp;scaron;ković&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Christopher Caes&lt;/strong&gt;, co-directors of the East Central European Center.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;From Europe to America, political landscapes have shifted in recent years in a way summed up in microcosm no better than by the trajectory of one small country, Hungary&amp;mdash;whose leader, Viktor Orb&amp;aacute;n, has gained outsized international notoriety as the bad boy of the European Union for his steadfast alternative to the liberal democracy that has dominated the Western world since 1989.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Orb&amp;aacute;nland&lt;/em&gt; is the fascinating story of a Danish journalist who moves to Hungary to gain an insight into the political complexities of this divisive European country. Along the way, he encounters people from all walks of life, and he learns as much about the Hungarians as about himself. In a narrative as absorbing as it is vital for the lessons it carries for a divided Western world: Can we get along with those on the other side of the fence? Is it worth even trying? His answers are surprising.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;By guiding us through a polarized landscape of differing opinions, Lasse Skytt delivers a broader perspective on Viktor Orb&amp;aacute;n&amp;rsquo;s Hungary, one that suggests possibilities for the future of Europe and America. His journey will leave us questioning our own truths, and, ultimately, which side we are on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lasse Skytt &lt;/strong&gt;(born 1987) is a Danish foreign correspondent who has covered Hungary and Central Europe for for almost a decade.

Can her legacy provide inspiration to those who are concerned about the future of democracy and security in Europe?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To explore these questions, renowned writer Kati Marton, whose recent biography of Angela Merkel, &lt;em&gt;The Chancellor &amp;ndash; The Remarkable Odyssey of Angela Merkel&lt;/em&gt; (Simon and Schuster, 2021), was published last fall to critical acclaim, will be joined by Michael Broening, Executive Director, Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung New York Office, and Sheri Berman, Professor of Political Science at Barnard College.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This event is jointly presented by Columbia Global Centers | Paris, the Sciences Po American Foundation, the European Institute, the Alliance Program.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_y0ngolEJR2qOBq6i2GLSHw"" target=""_blank""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Register&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speakers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kati Marton&lt;/strong&gt;, born in Hungary, has combined a career as a reporter and writer with human rights advocacy.

Looking at this &amp;ldquo;flotsam&amp;rdquo; that washed ashore, we will explore the relationship between these objects and images and how they shaped the imagination and experiences of Europe and of ourselves. How did these objects, images and messages reach an otherwise impervious Albania? How did they circulate once in Albania and what life and meanings did they take on? Did this relationship with the &amp;ldquo;beyond&amp;rdquo;, cherished and suffered by the citizens-inmates of a country otherwise closed to the world, lead to an inadvertent &amp;ldquo;colonization&amp;rdquo; of minds by these ethereal images built by and for Western media?&amp;nbsp;Or, did these highly censored or scarcely available objects and images allow Albanians to clandestinely escape across the porous borders of the imagination?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Speakers&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ardian Vehbiu&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a linguist, writer, translator and independent scholar.

Large velocities and high melt rates are thought to occur adjacent to highly turbulent subglacial discharge plumes. However, recent observations demonstrate that melt rates are also high far away from plumes, suggesting that other ocean processes may facilitate heat and salt fluxes to the ice-ocean interface. Using extensive in situ observations, as well as idealised large eddy simulations, we demonstrate that the subglacial discharge plume emanating from LeConte Glacier, Alaska, generates an energetic internal gravity wave field. The waves are persistent in time and fill the near-glacier fjord, accounting for ~ 50 % of the total observed kinetic energy near the ice-ocean boundary during the two-week September 2018 field campaign. They are characterised by coherent oscillations in velocity of magnitude 1 - 8 cm/s with a period of ~ 10 mins (close to the local buoyancy period) and a horizontal wavelength of 150 - 200 m. The signal was identified in two separate mooring records, one of which was located within 100 m of the terminus, suggesting that internal waves have the potential to enhance melting by driving flow directly at the ice-ocean interface. Accounting for wave velocities within a commonly used melt parameterisation, which assumes shear-driven boundary layer dynamics, results in a 40 - 80 % increase in the estimated melt rate relative to ambient (no wave) conditions.,X-BEDEWORK-DESCRIPTION-FORMAT : values : text : html"

Each woman was illustrated by a different woman illustrator/designer/artist from Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is a book about first female artists, writers, poets, social workers, national heroines, directors, scientists, musicians, doctors, activists, professors, and other exceptional women from BiH.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The initiative was started with the goal of increasing the visibility of women in Bosnia and Herzegovina and to encourage similar educational initiatives. It celebrates women who were trailblazers and pioneers in women&amp;rsquo;s rights and emancipation, who achieved worldwide fame in their respective fields of work and are some of the greatest treasures of BiH.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The book was published in 2019 and has since traveled to more than fifty countries.

An architect of twentieth-century neoclassicism, she experienced the transformative power of the Russian Revolution and created her greatest work - &lt;em&gt;Les Noces&lt;/em&gt; - under the influence of its avant-garde. Many of her ballets rested on the probing of gender boundaries, a mistrust of conventional gender roles, and the heightening of the ballerina&amp;#39;s technical and artistic prowess. A prominent member of Russia Abroad, she worked with leading figures of twentieth-century art, music, and ballet, including Stravinsky, Diaghilev, Poulenc, Alexandra Exter, Natalia Goncharova, Frederick Ashton, Alicia Markova, and Maria Tallchief. She was also a remarkable dancer in her own right with a bravura technique and powerful stage presence that enabled her to perform an unusually broad repertory. Finally, she was the author of an acclaimed volume of memoirs in addition to a major treatise on movement. Nijinska&amp;#39;s career sheds new light on the modern history of ballet and of modernism more generally, recuperating the memory of lost works and forgotten artists, many of them women. But it also reveals the sexism pervasive in the upper echelons of the early and mid-twentieth-century ballet world, barriers that women choreographers still confront.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Ways to Attend&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_V4ebVj4gQ1aoOj6JjceOdQ"" target=""_blank""&gt;Register for Zoom Webinar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/6W4V545H6K0"" target=""_blank""&gt;Watch on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In-person (CUID Only):&lt;strong&gt; Reserve Your Seat&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(see button below)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;","","2022-03-07 23:01:45","X-BEDEWORK-WAIT-LIST-LIMIT : values : text : 	0,X-BEDEWORK-REGISTRATION-START : values : text : 20220208T000000,X-BEDEWORK-UNI-ONLY-REG : values : text : 	YES,X-BEDEWORK-IMAGE : values : text : /public/images/2022-03-22 Lynn Garafola Book Talk 4x3-202202090404.png,X-BEDEWORK-REGISTRATION-END : values : text : 20220325T180000,X-BEDEWORK-THUMB-IMAGE : values : text : 	/public/images/2022-03-22 Lynn Garafola Book Talk 4x3-202202090404-thumb.png,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Type/Lecture,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Alumni,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Faculty,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Family Friendly,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Graduate Students,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Postdocs,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Prospective Students,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Public,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Staff,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Student,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Events open to/Trainees,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Category/International and Public Affairs,X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS : values : text : /user/agrp_calsuite-SIPA_HarrimanInstitute/Location/Morningside,X-BEDEWORK-MAX-TICKETS-PER-USER : values : text : 	1,X-BEDEWORK-MAX-TICKETS : values : text : 	100,X-BEDEWORK-SUBMITTEDBY : values : text : pb2855 for SIPA_HarrimanInstitute (agrp_SIPA_HarrimanInstitute),X-BEDEWORK-CUSTOM-URL-LABEL : values : text : For more information, please visit the Harriman Institute website,X-BEDEWORK-DESCRIPTION-FORMAT : values : text : html,X-BEDEWORK-CALSUITE : values : text : SIPA - Harriman Institute,X-BEDEWORK-REG-BUTTON-TEXT : values : text : Reserve Your Seat,X-BEDEWORK-SHORTTITLE : values : text : La Nijinska: Choreographer of the Modern"
