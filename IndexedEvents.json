Cheating will continue to be a persistent problem, however,&amp;nbsp;the research on cheating suggests that there are predictable conditions that can induce cheating behaviors. We&amp;rsquo;ll explore the research on cheating in higher education and use it to devise strategies to reduce cheating and even improve students&amp;rsquo; overall performance in our courses by fostering their own intrinsic motivations to learn deeply in our classes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;By the end of the session, participants should be able to:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Articulate the factors that can induce cheating in the classroom&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Describe at least one&amp;nbsp;strategy&amp;nbsp;for discouraging&amp;nbsp;cheating through assignment design&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This session is IN-PERSON&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and will be facilitated by Ian Althouse, Senior Assistant Director at CTL.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;***Registration will close the night before the session.

The panel will be introduced and moderated by Prof. Tun&amp;ccedil; \u015een (History Department).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Moving beyond narratives of conventional &amp;ldquo;Golden Age&amp;rdquo; narratives, this panel reexamines the scientific works of scholars in the Islamicate world through the lens of manuscript culture. Utilizing the recently digitized treasures of the Columbia University Libraries&amp;rsquo;&amp;nbsp; Manuscripts of the Muslim World (MWM) project, the panel presents in-depth case studies in the history of knowledge across the premodern Islamicate world. By foregrounding the manuscript cultures that shaped the production and exchange of astronomical and mathematical knowledge, this panel raises important questions about the role of manuscript cultures in shaping scientific inquiry and the circulation of knowledge across traditions. How might we read these scientific texts in new ways that take into account the different intellectual traditions that shaped them and their legacies on their own terms?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Aneka Kazlyna and Julia Tomasson are part of the curatorial team for the accompanying exhibit &amp;ldquo;Science, Nature and Beauty: Harmony and Cosmological Perspectives in Islamic Science&amp;rdquo; (open until March 3rd),&amp;nbsp; an exhibit that showcases over 90 manuscripts, instruments and objects from the Muslim World Manuscript collection housed in the Rare Book and Manuscript Library at the Columbia University Libraries. The exhibit is a collective curatorial effort that has involved students, faculty members, librarians and library staff working hand-in-hand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This event contributes to an understanding of Islamic science as a robust, diverse and lively scholarly endeavor, and as a central and non-reducible component of larger and non-linear histories, cultures and traditions of the arts and sciences.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;To visit the exhibit, please be aware of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://covid19.columbia.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;University COVID compliance requirements&lt;/a&gt;, and be prepared to show government-issued ID at the Library Information Office in order to enter Butler Library.&amp;nbsp;The hours for the Library Information Office can be found&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://hours.library.columbia.edu/locations/lio\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and for the Rare Book and Manuscript Library&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://hours.library.columbia.edu/locations/rbml\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;The exhibit is accompanied by&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt;n audio guide, which can be accessed&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://islamicsciencesexhibit.podcasts.library.columbia.edu/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;an e-brochure, which can be downloaded&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/vrpk-3269\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "kaoukab_chebaro", "location": "Online Event", "timestamp": "2023-05-01 12:00:00-04:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Online"}, {"tagName": "Humanities"}, {"tagName": "Graduate School of Arts and Sciences"}], "attendee": []}

Unfortunately, data center applications are extremely inefficient, wasting more than 60% of all processor cycles, and causing millions of dollars in operational expenses and energy costs. In this talk, I will present an overview of my vision to overcome this inefficiency using hardware/software co-design. In particular, I will focus on (1) systems interfaces using which software can reason about hardware inefficiencies; and (2) architectural abstractions using which software can avoid hardware inefficiencies. Finally, I will conclude by describing my ongoing and future research on democratizing hardware/software co-design to enable efficiency across the systems stack.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;h3&gt;Bio&lt;/h3&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Tanvir Ahmed Khan is a final-year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Michigan. His research brings together computer architecture, compilers, and operating systems to enable efficient data center processing. Consequently, his work has been adopted by Intel and ARM to improve the performance of data center applications. Bridging hardware and software, his research appears in venues like ISCA, MICRO, OSDI, PLDI, FAST, and EuroSys. His work has also been recognized with the MICRO 2022 Best Paper Award, DATE 2023 Best Paper Award Nomination, IEEE Micro Top Picks 2023 distinction, and multiple fellowships.&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "eliese_lissner", "location": "Mudd Hall, 500 W. 120 St., New York, NY 10027", "timestamp": "2023-05-02 11:00:00-04:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Seminar"}, {"tagName": "Morningside"}], "attendee": []}

This is due to their rapid growth rate, ability to develop resistance to chemotherapy, and the difficulties in transporting therapeutics across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), one of the tightest blood vessel barriers in humans. The lack of physiologically relevant in vitro human brain tumor models and the challenges in translating results from animal experiments to the clinic have greatly hindered progress in improving patient outcomes. We employ novel design strategies to engineer in vitro microfluidic brain cancer models and 3D tumor models from patient tissues to address this critical need. These platforms enable us to study tumor development in the brain, design new targeted nano-therapies for cancer, and understand the genetic mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapy. Our human-like tissue engineering models provide highly relevant pre-clinical tools that can be used to understand tumor progression and drug delivery, leading to better cancer patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Cynthia Hajal is a postdoctoral research fellow in the lab of Dr. Keith Ligon at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, with joint appointments at the Broad Institute and Harvard Medical School. She is building 3D brain tumor models from patient tissues to study the genetic mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapy. Prior to this, Cynthia received her S.M. and Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from MIT, where she worked in the lab of Dr. Roger Kamm to develop microfluidic models of the brain blood vessels and other organ systems to study cancer progression and drug delivery. Cynthia earned her B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and B.A. in Economics from Columbia University. During this time, she worked as a research assistant in the labs of Drs. James Hone and Michael Sheetz, where she designed nanoscale pillars for mechanosensing at the cellular scale. In her future lab, Cynthia will leverage her expertise in fluids, mechanics, and genetics to design complex microfluidic models of the tumor microenvironment to study cancer progression and drug delivery. These tissue engineering models will advance our understanding of cancer and drug delivery. They will be used to gain a more comprehensive insight into the impact of the tumor microenvironment on cancer.&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "amoy_ansell-poirier", "location": "Mudd Hall, 500 W. 120 St., New York, NY 10027", "timestamp": "2023-05-02 11:30:00-04:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Seminar"}, {"tagName": "Morningside"}], "attendee": []}

In this paper, we show that the IRF2&amp;times;CO2 is not constant, but also depends on the climatological base-state, increasing by ~25% for every doubling of CO2, and has increased by ~10% since the pre-industrial era primarily due to stratospheric cooling, implying a proportionate increase in climate sensitivity. This base-state dependence also explains about half of the intermodel spread in IRF2&amp;times;CO2, a problem that has persisted among climate models for nearly three decades.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\\n&lt;br /&gt;\\n&lt;strong&gt;Brief bio:&lt;/strong&gt; Haozhe He is a fifth-year PhD student at the University of Miami, working with Dr. Brian Soden.

Fatima learned how to serve others through joining AmeriCorps Vista in 2013, which catapulted her into a life of service. Her personal experiences and continuous service in the heart of systematically oppressed communities molded her into a cultivator of social equity. Serving as an AmeriCorps Vista, pushed her to become involved in combating police brutality through co-founding the Austin Justice Coalition (AJC) an Austin based social justice organization. Her work with AJC allowed her to participate in the creation of the body wearing camera policy for the Austin Police Department. She eventually attended and graduated from Southern University Law Center (SULC) in 2018. As a full-time law student Fatima co-founded Counter Balance: ATX (CBATX) a Austin-based self-care and social justice organization.

GaN device technology is poised to revolutionize high-power and high-frequency applications. Additionally, GaN can unlock new application spaces for electronic systems that are currently constrained by the lack of robust semiconductor devices for harsh environments. While silicon technology is limited to moderate temperatures, GaN electronics have demonstrated a vast temperature range of operation from cryogenic to 1000&amp;deg;C. Devices that can achieve reliable operation under these conditions have applications in the space, energy and environment, automotive, and defense sectors, as well as quantum computing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;In this seminar, I will describe the design and microfabrication of indium aluminum nitride/gallium nitride (InAlN/GaN) high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs), which leverage a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) conducting channel.&amp;nbsp; The lattice-matched InAlN/GaN heterostructure can enable co-fabrication of sensors and peripheral read-out circuitry on a single monolithically integrated chip.&amp;nbsp; Advances in techniques to improve high temperature performance reliability in InAlN/GaN HEMTs, such as the development of novel contact metallization schemes and geometries, will be discussed. Recent compelling developments in high-temperature capable solid-state 2DEG devices and piezoelectric MEMS resonators up to 600&amp;deg;C in air for extended durations will be presented. This work has resulted in the first demonstration of an uncooled GaN device successfully operating&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;in situ&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;the harsh environmental conditions found on the surface of Venus with the goal of enabling long duration robotic planetary exploration. These contributions support the use of the GaN heterostructure and provide a road map for further maturing this semiconductor platform. Finally, I will conclude by discussing the exciting future landscape of GaN and other wide-bandgap microelectronics for the development of critical next generation &amp;ldquo;beyond silicon&amp;quot; technologies.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biography:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Dr. Savannah Eisner received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Villanova University in 2017, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 2020 and 2023, respectively.&amp;nbsp; Her dissertation research focused on the use of uncooled GaN transistors for extreme environment space applications. She is currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Extreme Environment Microsystems Laboratory (XLab) in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Stanford University. Her research interests include the design of wide-bandgap micro/nanoelectronic sensors and systems. Dr. Eisner was a National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellow and a Future Technical Leaders Fellow of the NSF engineering research center for power optimization and electro-thermal systems.

These groups use close and highly transactional connections with politicians to acquire assets, secure financing and other preferential treatment.&amp;nbsp;Not only does the resulting economic firepower of these business groups allow them to dominate the various markets in which they operate, but it also allows them to achieve significant scale relative to the economy as a whole. This has been matched by a parallel and rapid accumulation and concentration of wealth. In their&amp;nbsp;recent book, Commander and Estrin call this the Connections World. Although it has, for the most part, supported Asia&amp;rsquo;s extraordinary growth, problems with this model, and the configuration of economic and political power that it has enabled, are mounting. Demographics challenge reliance on extensive growth while the attenuation of competition holds back productivity growth, limits the number of high-quality jobs and, most significantly, stands in the way of Asia shifting to greater reliance on innovation. New policies for corporate governance, taxation and the design of competition policy will be needed. Failure to come to grips with the Connections World will impair the brightness of Asia&amp;#39;s future.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Advanced registration is required.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;hr /&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author Biographies:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simon Commander &lt;/strong&gt;is Managing Partner of Altura Partners which provides policy advice to governments and companies in emerging economies.

For this purpose, we established a reference Sr and O isotope dataset of extant fish teeth from major water bodies in the Southern Levant. Fossil shark teeth were identified within Iron Age cultural layers (8&amp;ndash;9th century BCE) in the City of David, Jerusalem. Their enameloid Sr and O isotope compositions are both much lower than values typical for modern Mediterranean fish. Sr isotope stratigraphy places these fossil shark teeth into the Late Cretaceous (~80.3 &amp;plusmn; 3.2 Ma). This is further supported by their taxonomy, the high dentine apatite crystallinity, low organic C, high U and Nd contents, characteristics that are typical for fossils, and different from those of archaeological seabream teeth from the same cultural layers. Iron Age seabream enameloid has still modern seawater-like 87 Sr/ 86 Sr. However, elevated &amp;delta;18O values of seabream teeth point to a hypersaline seawater habitat, indicating that these seabreams were probably exported from the hypersaline Bardawil Lagoon in Sinai (Egypt) to the Southern Levant since the Iron Age period, possibly even earlier.&lt;br /&gt;\\n&lt;br /&gt;\\n&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\nThomas is a professor of paleontology at the University of Mainz. He develops and applies geochemical methods in fossil bones and teeth to reconstruct the biology, diet and ecology of extinct vertebrates as well as their fossilisation processes. Combining isotope and dental wear analysis on teeth, Thomas and his lab develop a toolbox for diet reconstruction in paleontology and archeology. Currently they are assessing the diet of mammal-like reptiles and dinosaurs to determine the evolution of plant-feeding among land vertebrates.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "daniel_green", "location": "Gary C.

However, much manipulation research focuses on rigid objects instead of highly deformable objects such as cables, fabrics, bags, liquids, and plants, which pose challenges due to their complex configuration spaces, dynamics, and self-occlusions. To achieve greater progress in robot manipulation of such diverse deformable objects, I advocate for an increased focus on learning and developing appropriate representations for robot manipulation. In this talk, I show how novel action-centric representations can lead to better imitation learning for manipulation of diverse deformable objects. I will show how such representations can be learned from color images, depth images, or point cloud observational data. My research demonstrates how novel representations can lead to an exciting new era for robot manipulation of complex objects.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Daniel Seita is a postdoctoral researcher at Carnegie Mellon University&amp;#39;s Robotics Institute, advised by David Held. His research interests are in computer vision and machine learning for robot manipulation, with a focus on using and developing novel observation and action representations to improve manipulation of challenging deformable objects. Daniel holds a PhD in computer science from the University of California, Berkeley, advised by John Canny and Ken Goldberg. He received undergraduate degrees in math and computer science from Williams College. Daniel&amp;#39;s research has been supported by a six-year Graduate Fellowship for STEM Diversity and by a two-year Berkeley Fellowship.

The talk will provide students a thorough understanding of growing debt crises unfolding across the world, focusing on specific country case studies and elements of the international financial and monetary system (IFMS). The talk will critically examine aspects&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;global economic governance, as well shortcomings of the&amp;nbsp;global financial safety net, that is supposed to underpin and provide a backstop to the international financial and monetary system during a crisis. The talk will critically examine the policies undertaken since Covid by key policy actors such as the DSSI, the Common Framework, and new allocation of SDR, and examine other policy pathways for a more just resolution to the debt and climate emergency.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christina&amp;nbsp;Laskaridis&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is Assistant Professor in Economics at the Open University, UK, and a visiting Fellow of St Edmund Hall at the University of Oxford.

Based on cultural anthropology research featuring major republics of Eastern Siberia-- Sakha (Yakutia), Buryatia and Tyva (Tuva) -- this talk highlights Indigenous concerns.&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "eileen_huhn", "location": "Hybrid Event", "timestamp": "2023-05-08 12:00:00-04:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Humanities"}, {"tagName": "Morningside"}], "attendee": []}

Socio-environmental problems in the ABC of lithium&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, by&amp;nbsp;Araceli Clavijo.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The need to mitigate climate change and move away from the economy&amp;#39;s dependence on fossil fuels has initiated a global transition to more sustainable or zero-carbon energy sources. Lithium is seen as a critical element in the production of &amp;quot;green&amp;quot; technologies that contribute to this transition. For many decades, the natural resources sector has been one of the main drivers of economic growth in Latin America and the Caribbean. Today, Argentina is positioned as one of the world&amp;#39;s leading producers of lithium, with its reserves located mainly in the Puna salt flats of the provinces of Salta, Catamarca, and Jujuy. Lithium could become an engine of development for the region, but what are the real impacts of the activity? Addressing socio-environmental challenges and ensuring compliance with the population&amp;#39;s access to environmental information will ensure a fair and equitable transition to electromobility.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lessons, opportunities, and challenges of anti-deforestation strategies in the Argentinean Chaco&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, by&amp;nbsp;Sebasti&amp;aacute;n Aguiar&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The Gran Chaco is a global deforestation hotspot where forests are rapidly being converted to crops and pasture for feeding cattle. A significant fraction of these agricultural products is marketed internationally. Although foreign currency derived from these exports is central for the economies of Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay, the agricultural expansion also triggers substantial ecological and social problems including biodiversity loss, greenhouse gas emissions, soil degradation, land privatization, and social unrest in rural territories, among others. Hence, balancing production and conservation has become one of the main challenges in the Chaco, and halting deforestation is a global policy goal. In Argentina, which accounts for half of the area of the Chaco ecoregion, a law to protect native forests (the &amp;ldquo;Forest Law&amp;rdquo;) was enacted in 2007. In this seminar, I will present some of the main challenges and opportunities that the Forest Law presents 15 years after its enactment. I will also discuss complementary actions for halting deforestation employed in other agricultural commodity frontiers that could be useful in the Argentinean Chaco.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "ilas", "location": "International Affairs Building, 420 W. 118 St., New York, NY 10027", "timestamp": "2023-05-08 17:00:00-04:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Morningside"}], "attendee": []}

In this film, Ukhman focuses on the struggle fought by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army in World War Two and the Ukrainian Armed Forces against Russian invaders today. The idea of the film came about in 2018 when Mykhailo met Hanna Abramovych-Zelena, former liaison officer for the legendary UIA (North) commander Klym Savur, during a visit to the region of Volyn. Abramovych-Zelena, now 93, shared how she was on a special assignment for the UIA when her neighbor turned her to the Russian secret police. Abramovych-Zelena, 16 at the time, was tortured, gang-raped, and sent to the GULAG. Another film character whose real-life experience inspired the film is UIA soldier Stepan Petrash who survived decades of Soviet camps after being captured by the Russians. Petrash shared how the UIA had fought against German and Soviet invaders.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Cut to the current all-out Russian war on Ukraine when Ukrainians, yet again, are faced with their mortal enemy in a war for their very survival. A young Ukrainian man, Nazar, whose ancestors fought in the UIA, decides this is not his war to fight and stays home while others go to the front.&amp;nbsp; While hiking in the forest, Nazar ends up camping overnight near the grave of a murdered UIA fighter; the fighter visits Nazar in his dream and confronts him about his decision to not fight in defense of his country. Nazar realizes that if the Russians are not thrown out of Ukraine his yet-unborn child will have no future. Nazar quits his job, leaves his pregnant girlfriend, and heads to the war.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The film features actors Larysa Rusnak, Oleksiy Palamarenko, Volodymyr Nikolaienko, Serhii Dovhyi, Anastasia Ponomarenko, Nazar Borushok, Kira Podolska, Svitlana Matviishyn.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Professional and amateur actors and real-life Ukrainian secret service men, special forces fighters and UAF soldiers took part in filming.&amp;nbsp;Some scenes were filmed in Volyn where the UPA resistance was born; others were shot on-location in the Donbas area near the town of Volnovakha, which was razed by the Russian army.&amp;nbsp; Authenticity was important to the filmmakers, who have used actual battlefield tactics and weapons used by Ukrainian forces against the Russians in the film.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The film is in Ukrainian with English subtitles&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "eileen_huhn", "location": "International Affairs Building, 420 W. 118 St., New York, NY 10027", "timestamp": "2023-05-08 18:30:00-04:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "International and Public Affairs"}, {"tagName": "Morningside"}], "attendee": []}

An exploration of the history of Europe&amp;rsquo;s post-war reckoning with fascism, the memoir urges the reader to remember the lessons learned in World War II in light of recent far-right and nationalist sentiments.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;During the war, Schwarz&amp;rsquo;s French grandfather was a police officer in Vichy France; on her German side, her grandparents were non-innocent bystanders, sometimes even taking advantage of Nazi policies. In this exploration, Schwarz considers the roles her grandparents played in perpetuating fascist policies during the war. Following three generations of her family&amp;rsquo;s history in post-war Europe, Schwarz investigates the ideologies that came into play, as well as the role of collective guilt in creating a democratic responsibility, highlighting the importance of being able to look back on history so as not to repeat it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Translated by Laura Marris from French,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Those Who Forget&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;its paperback was released in September 2022.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Based in Berlin,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;G&amp;eacute;raldine Schwarz&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;is a German-French journalist, documentary filmmaker, and author.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Those Who Forget&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is her first book.

Now nearly 30 years later, the current High Representative Christian Schmidt recently imposed controversial electoral laws during Bosnia&amp;#39;s October 2022 elections that will ultimately&amp;nbsp;inflate the numbers of elected Croats to the House of Peoples. Schmidt&amp;#39;s actions were responded to by massive demonstrations by Bosnians outraged by his actions. The US backed Schmidt&amp;#39;s actions, issuing a statement of support, surprising not only Bosnians but international observers, as well. The United States also played a key role in supporting Kosovo&amp;#39;s quest for independence that&amp;nbsp;was&amp;nbsp;declared in 2008 following 77 days of&amp;nbsp;aerial bombing led&amp;nbsp;by the United States . And in recent days, the US has been applying coercive&amp;nbsp;diplomacy to Prime Minister Albin Kurti&amp;#39;s leadership of the Kosovo&amp;nbsp;gobernment in another turnabout in US foreign policy. More broadly, the US has made a number of overtures of support to Aleksandar Vucic and the Serbian government who is not a ally of the United States and while they have pledged to cooperate with NATO, Serbia has no&amp;nbsp;aspirations to join NATO and become a member of the&amp;nbsp; Atlantic Security alliance. Indeed, Serbia is arguably the strongest supporter of Russia not only in the Balkans, but across Europe. Why is the US supporting open proxies to Putin? It appears that the US has foresaken&amp;nbsp;some of its best friends in the Western Balkans. Why? and Why now? This panel discussion with examine these questions and more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "eileen_huhn", "location": "International Affairs Building, 420 W. 118 St., New York, NY 10027", "timestamp": "2023-05-09 12:00:00-04:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "International and Public Affairs"}, {"tagName": "Morningside"}], "attendee": []}

Avicenna is presented primarily as a physician, rather than as a philosopher, among the &amp;ldquo;spiriti magni&amp;rdquo; of Limbo, despite the enormous influence of the Latin translations of his philosophical work, the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Book of the Cure/Healing&lt;/em&gt;, surely well-known to Dante. Also, he is portrayed in agreement with his arch-enemy in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;falsafa&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Averroes, whose criticisms of Avicenna in his commentaries on Aristotle could not have escaped Dante. Moreover, the presence of Avicenna, together with Averroes and Saladin, in Limbo is surprising since these three unbaptized Muslims neither lived before Christ nor were totally unaware of him, as the other inhabitants of this otherworldly space are said to be. Finally, the status of Avicenna, Averroes, and Saladin in the &amp;ldquo;city of lights&amp;rdquo; that is Limbo is sharply opposed to that of Mu\u1e25ammad and \u02bfAl\u012b in the eighth circle of Hell (&lt;em&gt;Inf&lt;/em&gt;.

We have recently introduced a new concept&amp;nbsp; for rocket thrusters that exploits the mechanism behind solar flares, where magnetic energy is converted to kinetic energy through the process of magnetic reconnection.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Theoretical and computational studies of fast magnetic reconnection in PPPL&amp;rsquo;s National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) led to the first experimental evidence of plasmoids, plasma objects enclosed by magnetic fields that are detached from the externally applied fields (PRL 2015 &lt;a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.205003\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.205003&lt;/a&gt;). Inspired by these studies of fundamental processes in fusion experiments, using state-of-the-art simulations, I will demonstrate that a particular configuration of electric and magnetic fields can both create plasma and accelerate it by continuously producing plasmoids via the process of fast magnetic reconnection. [&lt;a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022377820001476\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Journal of Plasma Physics 86, Issue 6, (2020)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022377820001476\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;]&lt;/a&gt; High and variable exhaust velocities as well as large continuously adjustable thrust are the key benefits of magnetic reconnection thruster. The new rocket is scalable from short to long range missions, ranging from solar powered drone delivery from LEO to the moon, as well as nuclear powered interplanetary space exploration. The engine can use a wide variety of gases as propellant without sacrificing performance, allowing it to be refueled with gases extracted from asteroids or the lunar surface.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt; Fatima Ebrahimi is a principal research physicist in the PPPL Theory Department and an affiliated research scholar in the Department of Astrophysical Sciences, Princeton University. Her research interests span from magnetically confined fusion plasmas to flow-driven plasmas, such as astrophysical accretion disks. Before PPPL, she was a research associate at the Alfven Laboratory, Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden for one year, and then was a research associate and research scientist with the National Science Foundation (NSF) Frontier Center for Magnetic Self-Organization in Laboratory and Astrophysical Plasmas (CMSO) at the University of Wisconsin. Before her research appointment at Princeton University in 2013, she was a research assistant professor at the University of New Hampshire. She received her Ph.D. in plasma physics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2003.&amp;nbsp;Ebrahimi has been serving on DPP, Sherwood and DCOMP Executive committees as well as the APS Informing the Public committee. She is the inventor of a concept for a magnetic reconnection plasma-based rocket thruster (the most read JPP article ever and 2021 most read aerospace story of Institution of Mechanical Engineers).&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "apam_department", "location": "Mudd Hall, 500 W. 120 St., New York, NY 10027", "timestamp": "2023-05-10 15:00:00-04:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Morningside"}], "attendee": []}

This presentation highlights new insights in reconstructing these forcings over space and time at two sites: George Washington&amp;rsquo;s Mount Vernon agricultural plantation, Virginia, and Palmaghatt Ravine, New York. At Mount Vernon, enslaved labor grew tobacco, wheat, and other produce; however, Washington also described the farm as an English landscape with forests and scattered trees. Comparing tree-ring sampling designs at two spatial scales shows that selecting a similar number of trees across a larger search area is more likely to reconstruct the spatial pattern of forest history of this historical site. LiDAR bare surface elevation shows evidence of cross-plowing, an agricultural method frequently used by Washington, in areas that are now reforested. The preserved record of land use apparent in tree-rings, forest composition, and LiDAR highlights the long duration of land-use legacies from plantation agriculture. At Palmaghatt Ravine, tree-ring records record natural and anthropogenic canopy disturbance events over time that obscure underlying climate responses. Applying age-dependent splines, an offshoot of the detrending splines first developed at Lamont, enables a targeted detrending of canopy release events from tree-ring widths. This method provides an alternative for isolating climate signals in closed-canopy forests and also enables reconstructions of the ecological responses of tree growth to past canopy disturbance events.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speark&amp;#39;s Bio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Daniel Druckenbrod received his Ph.D. in environmental sciences from the University of Virginia in 2003 and currently holds the rank of professor of environmental sciences at Rider University. Prior to this position, Dan was a postdoctoral research associate in the Environmental Sciences Division of Oak Ridge National Lab and an assistant professor at Longwood University. Dan uses tree rings, forest surveys, simulation models, and historical documents to study long-term changes to forests and their environments. His projects include studies of forests and land-use legacies at historical sites, including George Washington&amp;rsquo;s Mount Vernon and Thomas Jefferson&amp;rsquo;s Monticello plantations. He is also researching the historical connection between Rider University&amp;#39;s woods and Aldo Leopold during his time in Lawrenceville over a century ago. Dan has collaborated on projects studying the growth and water use of eastern deciduous forests in response to air pollution and climate. He is currently collaborating with the Lamont Tree-Ring Lab investigating past climate change from tree rings across Australia, New Zealand, and Southeast Asia. Dan previously served as the Director of Rider&amp;#39;s Sustainability Studies Program from 2012 to 2021 and the Chair of the Department of Geological, Environmental, and Marine Sciences from 2021 to 2022.&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "hung_nguyen", "location": "Gary C.

By comparison, little attention has been paid to biohydrogen (Bio-H2), a type of hydrogen produced from organic waste streams (e.g., agricultural waste) that can potentially yield a carbon-removing (or climate-positive) fuel when coupled with efficient carbon capture and storage. This carbon-negative hydrogen can offer a solution for decarbonizing energy-intensive industrial processes such as iron and steel production. At present, however, the wide deployment of carbon-negative Bio-H2 still faces considerable obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Please join the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University&amp;#39;s School of International and Public Affairs to discuss key findings from its latest report on hydrogen, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/publications/the-potential-role-of-biohydrogen-in-creating-a-net-zero-world/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;The Potential Role of Biohydrogen in the Net-Zero World: The Production and Applications of Carbon-Negative Hydrogen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.

This powerful approach identifies genes that are, on&amp;nbsp;average, drivers in&amp;nbsp;the cohort. However, the status of a gene as a driver in&amp;nbsp;any individual cancer remains uncertain. In this talk, I will&amp;nbsp;describe how&amp;nbsp;multi-region sequencing, phylogenetics and computational biology provides an in&amp;nbsp;vivo test of&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;driverness&amp;rdquo; directly in patient tumours. If a driver is under&amp;nbsp;selection, it leads to characteristic patterning of intra-tumour heterogeneity.&amp;nbsp;Application of this method in a colorectal cancer dataset shows many&amp;nbsp;putative drivers&amp;nbsp;are not actually under appreciable selection in individual&amp;nbsp;cancers, and also that some subclonal expansions are&amp;nbsp;driven by as-yet unknown&amp;nbsp;driver alterations. Further, overlaying other &amp;lsquo;omic data provides a route to characterise cancer cell phenotypic plasticity in vivo, and to discover non-genetic drivers of cancer evolution.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaker Bio:&lt;/strong&gt; Prof Trevor Graham is Director of the Centre for Evolution and Cancer at the Institute of Cancer Research, London.

It takes migration as the central concept and historical event behind feminist narratives of constructed environments and spatial and material practices, testing migration as a method of writing antipatriarchal, antiracist, anticasteist, and antiformalist architectural histories. In historiographical solidarity with people in the past and present deterritorialized and dispossessed of land and home, collaborators on this project undertake a feminist practice of history writing and make a space for migrant narratives of built environments.

Further technological advances demand both additive and subtractive manufacturing methods with vastly improved precision compared to typical approaches.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;In this seminar, I will first describe our development of Angstrom-precise additive manufacturing for 2D materials leveraging chemical vapor deposition and &amp;lsquo;smart&amp;rsquo; processes. While the number of exciting physical phenomena observed in bilayer graphene increases, a significant gap persists in transforming these discoveries into practical applications, owing to the small-scale superlattices obtained via top-down approaches. We realized layer-by-layer (that is, Frank-van der Merwe) manufacturing in large-scale bilayer graphene, with no island impurities, which is unprecedented in any van der Waals-stacked semiconductors. After growth, we utilized the Marangoni effect, also known as the &amp;lsquo;tears of wine&amp;rsquo;, to enable &amp;lsquo;autonomous&amp;rsquo; transfer by building a surface tension gradient in transfer liquids. Furthermore, machine learning is adopted to assist spectroscopy, enabling the &amp;lsquo;smart&amp;rsquo; characterization following Angstrom-precise manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;In addition, I will showcase an application of single-layer graphene to address one of the key challenges in integrated circuit packaging &amp;ndash; the reliability of bonding (welding) technology. Specifically, the bonding temperature is lowered by introducing nano-cone features to increase local stress. A one-atomic-thick graphene interlayer on the Cu was introduced to prevent the diffusion to form the intermetallic compounds that are harmful to the reliability of the bonding. The proposed scheme inherently solves both high bonding temperature and interfacial diffusion issues. Interestingly, the insertion of Angstrom-scale graphene on the Cu nanostructures allows us to observe a macro-scale phenomenon where reliable bonding joints are manufactured at a bonding temperature as low as 150 &amp;ordm;C, which is also the lowest reported value to date for Cu bonding technology.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;At last, I will discuss our recent progress in the subtractive manufacturing of nanomaterials in monolayer precision for quantum applications. Our development of atomic layer etching, a reversal process of conventional atomic layer deposition, enables layer-by-layer engineering of the surfaces of nanomaterials to remedy Angstrom-scale imperfections in photonic and electronic quantum devices.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Haozhe &amp;lsquo;Harry&amp;rsquo; Wang is currently KNI Prize Postdoctoral Fellow at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). His research focuses on atomic layer etching (ALE) technology to engineer surface imperfections with Angstrom precision.

This talk will synthesize findings from our recent review of associations between social media use and adolescent social and emotional well-being and present new findings from our large study of adolescents followed daily via their mobile devices.

Returning to primarily found-footage materials for the first time since&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Event&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(which documented the 1991 coup), in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Trial&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(whose Russian title --&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Process&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;-- suggests Franz Kafka&amp;#39;s novel), Loznitsa condenses an eleven-day show trial hearing from 1930 into just over two hours, alternating bureaucratic procedure and fabricated testimony with snippets of popular demonstrations, to produce &amp;quot;a nonfiction account of a fastidiously composed fiction.&amp;quot; Similarly,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;State Funeral&lt;/em&gt;, Loznitsa&amp;#39;s second found footage film on Stalinist period, chronicles the Soviet Union&amp;#39;s national mourning of the death of Joseph Stalin based on shot footage that no one ever saw: a thirty-eight minute film called&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Great Farewell&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;made by four leading Soviet directors to commemorate Stalin&amp;#39;s death, which was never screened during the Soviet period. Loznitsa uses footage shot in the last four days of the funeral to tell a different story from the one intended by the original filmmakers, but which nevertheless retain the &amp;quot;truth&amp;quot; of the original. Indeed, the basic structure of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;State Funeral&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is taken from Vertex&amp;#39;s 1925&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Kinopravda&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;#24 /&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Lenin&amp;#39;s Kinopravda&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(and repeated in his 1934&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Three Songs of Lenin&lt;/em&gt;) -- the model for a nation grieving the loss of its leader. This talk will consider Loznitsa&amp;#39;s found footage / compilation films in the context of early Soviet avant-garde documentary practices that clearly serve as the context for the two films, looking specifically at the uses and reuses of the original source material, including editing, reframing, and sound.&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "eileen_huhn", "location": "Hybrid Event", "timestamp": "2023-05-22 16:15:00-04:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Humanities"}, {"tagName": "Morningside"}], "attendee": []}

Foreign excavators recruited workforces from landless Fellahin, local Bedouin, and young villagers to dig ancient soil through the winter months before the annual Nile inundation in the summer. Most archaeological sites were moreover buried under tells (artificial mounds) and situated on modern farmland. Territorial disputes were commonplace. Archaeologists sought to preserve the soil in situ, while farmers needed to rotate and redistribute it. The messy growth of British Egyptology was therefore predicated on the identification, popularization, demarcation, and especially, long-distance control of a new scientific space termed the &amp;ldquo;field site.&amp;rdquo; This talk will denaturalize the field site by exploring the literal shared ground between archaeology and agriculture, and the process by which Pharaonic ruins were made archaeological through Egyptian dispossession and exploitation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;h3&gt;Event Speaker&lt;/h3&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://gallatin.nyu.edu/people/faculty/mg7674.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Meira Gold&lt;/a&gt;, Assistant Professor at New York University Gallatin&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;h3&gt;Event Information&lt;/h3&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This event is free and open to the public; &lt;a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/522858372467/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Registration&lt;/a&gt; required.

Eva, Sasha and Kolya are waiting for their fate to be decided in a temporary children&amp;#39;s shelter, whose teachers and carers give the children moments of joy and peace.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;There was neither a script, nor rehearsals, nor even takes when filming&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;A House Made of Splinters&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;There was only me, the camera and my assistant. So it became easier for children to open up and be themselves.

Thanks to one of the closed screenings the teenager, Kolya was adopted by a family that was impressed by the boy&amp;#39;s story&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;quot; Azad Safarov said, the film&amp;rsquo;s assistant director and line producer.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Lena Rozvadovska, a psychologist and a human rights activist, all doors to the children&amp;#39;s world were opened for the film crew.

It is the poetic journey of H&amp;eacute;l&amp;egrave;ne Cixous. The characters are depicted through a cinematic language that privileges a sequential progression whose goal is to unveil the mysteries of an intellectual artist&amp;rsquo;s creative search, of her intimate inspirations, and of her anti-racist and anti-sexist political involvements.&lt;br /&gt;\\n&lt;br /&gt;\\nThe film flows like a work of fiction featuring the Algerian-born philosopher Jacques Derrida and artist Adel Abdessemed, Ariane Mnouchkine, and her cosmopolitan theater company as H&amp;eacute;l&amp;egrave;ne Cixous&amp;#39;s entourage. Cixous explores the wounds of our time and allows us to hear the cry of literature. The history of dozens of members of her German-Jewish family who were assassinated in the death camps, and the trauma of the recent wars of decolonization in Africa are part of the life of this major figure of French literature born in Oran, Algeria shortly before the start of the Second World War.

Contrary to common belief, the human capacity for rational judgment is much more limited, especially when it comes to dealing with change and the conflict that can result. Neuroscience can help explain why situations can escalate so quickly, and the negative consequences that can result. This foundational understanding, which provides evidence that many personality traits, including how to relate to other individuals and groups, has some basis in the biology of the brain. There is a balancing act between parts of the brain that deal with memories, pleasures, and fears and the analytical and logical processing function. These parts can vary between individuals and groups and impact their perceptions of situations. In this webinar, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn how the brain dictates our behavior while we undergo change especially when it&amp;rsquo;s unwelcome or unexpected. We&amp;rsquo;ll explore practical approaches to managing the conflict that can emerge from the change.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/574518298697\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Register here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;F\ufeffor further information please contact Kjerstin Pugh (kep2137@columbia.edu).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;For additional information about program offerings at Columbia University&amp;rsquo;s School of Professional Studies, please contact an Admissions Counselor at 212-854-9666 or inquire@sps.columbia.edu.&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "school_of_professional_studies", "location": "Online Event", "timestamp": "2023-05-23 12:00:00-04:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Online"}, {"tagName": "Seminar"}], "attendee": []}

The prediction skill of the MJO in many operational models is lower than its potential predictability, partly due to our limited understanding of its predictability source. Here, we investigate the source of the MJO predictability by combining machine learning (ML) with a 1200-year-long Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2) simulation. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for MJO prediction is first trained using the CESM2 simulation and then fine-tuned using observation via transfer learning. The source of MJO predictability in the CNN is examined via eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods that quantify the relative importance of the input variable. Our CNN outperforms previous ML models and many operational forecasts with the prediction skill of about 25 days. The XAI methods highlight precipitable water anomalies over the Indo-Pacific warm pool as key precursors of the subsequent MJO development for 1-3 weeks forecast lead times. Our results suggest that a realistic representation of moisture dynamics is crucial for accurate MJO prediction.&lt;br /&gt;\\n&lt;br /&gt;\\n&lt;strong&gt;Biography:&lt;/strong&gt; Daehyun Kim is an Associate Professor in Atmospheric Sciences in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Washington.

Advocating for art as &amp;lsquo;the national treasure and not a mere commodity&amp;rsquo;, Boichuk arrived at a synthesis of styles, drawing on Byzantine art, pre-Renaissance Italian frescoes, Ukrainian folk art, and French symbolism. In the early Soviet period, his studio emerged as a school of monumental art, with its students completing numerous state commissions for public spaces and buildings. Boichuk&amp;rsquo;s method and artistic vocabulary were henceforth applied to forging a new proletarian society. State cooperation was short-lived, however: labeled as bourgeois nationalists, Boichuk and a close circle of his associates were executed during the Stalinist purges of the 1930s, with most of their public art subsequently destroyed. Building on the existing scholarship, this talk examines Boichuk&amp;#39;s and his school&amp;#39;s commitment to both Soviet and Ukrainian culture in Soviet Ukraine of the 1920s, at the time when local intelligentsia pursued an autonomous cultural trajectory that ran in parallel to the Moscow-centre and was not dictated by it.&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "eileen_huhn", "location": "Hybrid Event", "timestamp": "2023-05-23 16:00:00-04:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Arts"}, {"tagName": "Morningside"}], "attendee": []}

A Deep Dive into Epigenomics&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract: &lt;/strong&gt;A stem cell needs to make a series of fate decisions when committing to one cellular lineage over another. Cell fate is regulated by the interplay of multiple epigenomic layers &amp;mdash; the collection of molecular and structural modifications on top of the genome &amp;mdash; such as chromatin accessibility. Investigation and prediction of cell fate decisions would yield comprehensive insights into the epigenomic rules governing genome function, which ultimately opens up new diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities for human diseases. In this talk, I will present a few recently developed single-cell technologies, including SHARE-seqV2, and their associated computational approaches to gain insights into gene regulation. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaker Biography:&lt;/strong&gt; Dr. Sai Ma is an Assistant Professor of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, a member of Icahn Genomics Institute, a member of the Skin Biology and Diseases Resource-based Center at Mount Sinai (SBDRC), and an affiliate member of the New York Genome Center (NYGC). Sai earned his Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Chemistry from Chu Kochen Honors College at Zhejiang University. He then moved to the US and earned his Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from a joint program between Virginia Tech and Wake Forest University. Mentored by Dr. Chang Lu, Sai developed microfluidics-based assays for mapping epigenomes in a tiny amount of primary tissues. He received his postdoctoral training from Aviv Regev and Jason Buenrostro at Broad Institute and Harvard Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology (HSCRB). His laboratory primarily focuses on innovating experimental and computational tools to investigate epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation in single-cells across dynamic cell fate transitions. By integrating approaches across molecular biology, microfluidics, imaging, engineering, and bioinformatics, Sai seeks to elucidate the regulatory diversity of single cells within diverse healthy and diseased tissues, including skin differentiation, hematopoiesis, autoimmune diseases, and tumor progression.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "lorenza_favrot", "location": "On Campus", "timestamp": "2023-03-18 14:00:00-04:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Seminar"}, {"tagName": "Morningside"}], "attendee": []}

However, the biological mechanisms underlying human ovarian aging have been poorly understood. To understand the molecular, cellular, and genetic basis of ovarian aging in humans, we performed integrative single-nuclei multi-omics analyses of young and reproductively aged human ovaries. Our analysis reveals coordinated changes in the regulatory landscapes across all cell types in the ovary during aging, characterized by transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility signatures of the canonical &amp;ldquo;Hallmarks of Ageing&amp;rdquo;. By performing integrative analyses of our single-nuclei multi-omics data with genetic variants associated with age at natural menopause from genome-wide association studies, we demonstrate a global impact of functional genetic variants on changes in gene regulatory networks across ovarian cell types. Our work provides a comprehensive multimodal landscape of human ovarian aging and mechanistic insights into inherited variation influencing the timing of menopause. Our results raise the hope that geroprotectors targeting the &amp;ldquo;Hallmarks of Aging&amp;rdquo; may be used to delay ovarian aging, thereby promoting reproductive health and extending healthspan and longevity in women.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This event will be hybrid:&lt;br /&gt;\\nIn-person Location -&amp;nbsp;622 West 168th St.PH-10-405A/B&lt;br /&gt;\\nRegister below for Zoom link&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This event is hosted as part of the monthly seminar series featuring leaders in precision medicine from across the nation.&lt;br /&gt;\\nPresented by the Precision Medicine Resource of the Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This event is supported in part by a gift from Pfizer to Columbia.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "dhriti_jagannathan", "location": "Online Event", "timestamp": "2023-03-19 16:00:00-04:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Online"}, {"tagName": "Seminar"}], "attendee": []}

Specific topics will include integrating germline genetic, gene expression, and exposomic data, gene-environment interaction, mediation, and polygenetic risk scores for assessing risk, estimating subgroups, and selecting relevant features.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This three-day intensive workshop will provide an overview of multiple approaches to analyze multiple omic data types measured on the same individuals or via the use of summary statistic data. Instructors have experience in developing and applying methods for omic analysis in genetic and environmental epidemiology and are members of an active program project focused on developing statistical methods for integrated analysis. The workshop will include seminar lectures with hands-on computer lab sessions to put concepts into practice. Since the analysis of multi-omic data is broad in scope, the workshop will survey a range of approaches and highlight the appropriate application and interpretation of each approach for specific research questions. The lab sessions will provide an opportunity to work hands-on with different types of omic data.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;By the end of the workshop, participants will be familiar with the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Data reduction, including clustering.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Regression analysis, including regularized regression, hierarchical models, and partial least squares.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Interaction analysis and Genome-wide interaction scans (GWIS).&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Mediation analysis.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Polygenic/polyexposure analysis.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Integrative analysis using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Investigators from any institution and from all career stages are welcome to attend, and we particularly encourage trainees and early-stage investigators to participate.

African American physicians, scientists, scholars, and reformers believed that eugenics, along with other political and social activism, offered a solution to racial discrimination by improving the biological composition of the race. Though eugenic measures were ultimately weaponized against African Americans, there were some who believed that forms of eugenics could be mobilized to improve the health and welfare of the race. This talk will examine the ways by which African Americans respond to, reinterpret, and critique the scientific racism embedded within the eugenics movement as part of a larger discourse of black eugenics.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;h3&gt;Event Speaker&lt;/h3&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://sf.princeton.edu/people/ayah-nuriddin\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Ayah Nuriddin&lt;/a&gt;, Cotsen Postdoctoral Fellow at Princeton University&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;h3&gt;Event Information&lt;/h3&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This event is free and open to the public; &lt;a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/518058235127/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Registration&lt;/a&gt; required.

Unfortunately, the cost of storing electricity is still higher than generating electricity. In addition to cost, the current version of lithium-ion batteries is unlikely to meet the requirements of all existing and future applications with different energy-to-power ratios and safety sensitivities. Since 2017, our lab at Georgia Tech has been working on several rechargeable battery technologies that have unique advantages over lithium-ion as well as their own challenges. Targeting those challenges, we designed, fabricated and analyzed new materials and reactors with enhanced reaction and transport properties at the nano- and microscale.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;For example, metallic zinc as a rechargeable anode material for aqueous batteries has gained tremendous attention with merits of intrinsic safety, low cost, and high theoretical volumetric capacity (5,854 mAh/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Among zinc-based batteries, Zn-air batteries are promising with the highest theoretical volumetric energy density (4,931 Wh/L). Rechargeable zinc anode has recently achieved progress in neutral electrolytes, yet developed slowly in alkaline electrolytes, which are kinetically favorable for air cathodes. Passivation, dissolution, and hydrogen evolution are three main reasons for irreversibility of zinc anodes in alkaline electrolytes, which limits the rechargeability and usable energy density. We carried out material engineering at the nanoscale to overcome these three challenges of zinc anode. We have also used gas chromatography quantitative analysis and operando microscopy to quantify gas evolution side reaction and visualize the reaction on electrodes during operation, respectively. In this talk, I will present our findings on zinc-based batteries, as well as solid-state batteries and redox flow batteries, which could potentially expand the portfolio of electrochemical energy storage technologies for sustainable energy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biography: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Nian Liu is an Assistant Professor at School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Georgia Tech. He received B.S. in 2009 from Fudan University, and Ph.D. in 2014 from Stanford University, where he worked on the structure design for Si anodes for high-energy Li-ion batteries. From 2014 to 2016, he worked at Stanford University as a postdoc, where he developed in situ optical microscopy to probe beam-sensitive battery reactions. Dr. Liu&amp;rsquo;s lab at Georgia Tech is broadly interested in the combination of materials, electrochemistry, and operando microscopy for studying the global energy challenges. Specifically, the Liu&amp;rsquo;s lab is focusing on electric vehicle battery and stationary battery science and technologies.

While our current knowledge of plasma physics and technical capabilities is sufficiently mature for us to attempt to build fusion power reactors, the path to economic competitiveness lies with compact, high-energy-density fusion reactors. This requires operation at, simultaneously, physics parameters that are close to the edge of plasma instabilities and the technical possibilities of materials engineering and nuclear operation, which is challenging.&lt;br /&gt;\\n&lt;br /&gt;\\nPlasma Control Group at Princeton University try to tackle these challenges with a practical engineering perspective that incorporates relevant insights from plasma physics. I will talk about some of our recent accomplishments: 1) DESC, a fast and accurate stellarator code suit for solving equilibria and optimizing 2) Divertorlets, a non-evaporative liquid metal divertor that allows low recycling plasma regime that may allow high temperature from the plasma core to the wall 3) Application of machine learning for real-time fusion plasma behavior prediction and manipulation 4) What does the optimization studies tell us about the fusion reactor design for the future electric grid dominated by renewables?&lt;br /&gt;\\n&lt;br /&gt;\\nBio: Egemen Kolemen in an Associate Professor at Princeton University&amp;rsquo;s Mechanical &amp;amp; Aerospace Engineering jointly appointed with the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment and the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL). He is the Director of Program in Sustainable Energy, recipient of the David J. Rose Excellence in Fusion Engineering Award and an ITER Scientist Fellow. His research combines engineering and physics analysis to enable economically feasible fusion reactors. He currently leads research on machine learning, real-time diagnostics and control at KSTAR, NSTX-U and DIII-D. He directs liquid metal divertor and low temperature diagnostics labs. On the theoretical side, his group develops software for stellarator optimization and economical analysis of fusion reactor.&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "apam_department", "location": "Mudd Hall, 500 W. 120 St., New York, NY 10027", "timestamp": "2023-03-27 15:00:00-04:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Morningside"}], "attendee": []}

This expansion reduced psychological distress for women and noncustodial parents&amp;mdash;the groups that benefitted the most in terms of increased after-bonus earnings.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;For more information to register:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://aging.columbia.edu/events/seminar-emilie-courtin-health-effects-paycheck-plus-rct\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;https://aging.columbia.edu/events/seminar-emilie-courtin-health-effects-paycheck-plus-rct&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "caitlin_hawke", "location": "Online Event", "timestamp": "2023-03-31 11:30:00-04:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Online"}, {"tagName": "Seminar"}, {"tagName": "Social Sciences"}], "attendee": []}

Wade, there has been increased interest and advocacy around SMA, despite the fact that it continues to be criminalized in a myriad of ways. This presentation by If/When/How will provide an overview of 1) self-managed abortion including what it means and why people choose to self-manage, and 2) the current legal landscape of SMA including how and why people are criminalized.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speakers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Catherine Guichardo&lt;/strong&gt; (she/her) is If/When/How&amp;rsquo;s Helpline Counsel.

Russian hybrid aggression preceded a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. This hybrid war had multilevel dimensions including interpretation of the past. During 2014-2016 Russia disseminated historical fakes that had to present Ukraine as an artificial and failed state. Covering the situation in Ukraine, Russian media uses the frame of WWII, which is extremely ideologies in contemporary Russian public discourse. The Russian-supported campaign in Donbas is predicated as a &amp;quot;Little Patriotic War&amp;quot; -- a repetition or re-enactment of &amp;quot;The Great Patriotic War.&amp;quot; What other historical fakes were used by Russia? How have these fakes affected reality?

Quantifying this potential has been proven difficult in numerical weather prediction systems because tropical sub-seasonal variability tends to be poorly represented in such models. One possible exception is the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Integrated Forecast System (ECMWF), which has been recently shown to have much improved representation of sub-seasonal tropical variability. In this study, we use ECMWF reforecasts to investigate the predicted evolution of CCEW and the MJO and how they might relate to sub-seasonal practical and potential forecast skill.&amp;nbsp; It is shown that systematic model errors in the representation of their amplitude and propagation characteristics strongly limits their role as a deterministic pathway to improve sub-seasonal predictions. (Joint work by Juliana Dias, Maria Gehne and George Kiladis)&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Bio: Juliana Dias is a research physical scientist at the Physical Sciences Laboratory (PSL) of the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratories in Boulder Colorado.&amp;nbsp; Her main interests include coupling between tropical convection and the large-scale atmospheric circulation, tropical-extratropical interactions, equatorial waves dynamics, and predictability of the atmosphere on daily to sub-seasonal time scales. Her work is focused on various aspects of tropical sub-seasonal variability, &amp;nbsp;tropical-extratropical interactions and on how those impact sub-seasonal predictions. Juliana&amp;#39;s current projects include developing model diagnostics aimed at improving model&amp;#39;s representation of tropical variability and understanding origins of tropical forecast errors as well as their impacts on extratropical subseasonal predictions.&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "apam_department", "location": "Mudd Hall, 500 W. 120 St., New York, NY 10027", "timestamp": "2023-04-02 13:30:00-04:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Morningside"}], "attendee": []}

To produce visible morphological changes such gene expression patterns must be translated into local differences in force production and in the passive and active physical properties of cells that respond to those forces.&amp;nbsp;My talk will review the relationship between gene activities and the physical forces that produce epithelial folds and other morphological changes in the early Drosophila embryo.&amp;nbsp;The experiments involve live imaging of cytoskeleton and cell adhesion, as well as novel&amp;nbsp;strategies to measure physical parameters like viscosity and elasticity in living embryos.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT THE SPEAKER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eric Wieschaus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, Ph.D.&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Squibb Professor of Molecular Biology, Princeton University; Nobel Prize Winner (1995)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;In the late 1970s, Eric Wieschaus and Christiane N&amp;uuml;sslein-Volhard carried out large-scale mutagenesis screens to identify genes controlling embryonic development in Drosophila.&amp;nbsp; These screens were designed to identify key components in&amp;nbsp;all&amp;nbsp;pathways governing morphology, patterning and differentiation and established a basic &amp;ldquo;tool box&amp;rdquo; of factors that operate in the Drosophila embryo.&amp;nbsp; His recent work focuses on the mechanics of cell shape change and movement during gastrulation, and on information theory and biophysical measurements to investigate how patterns of gene activity are established in the early embryo.&amp;nbsp; Wieschaus was awarded the 1995 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT DR. RICHARD SKALAK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Richard Skalak, who was one of the first researchers in the field of bioengineering, taught at Columbia for more than 40 years. Skalak was among the first researchers to use engineering principles to understand biological problems. He is known for his groundbreaking work in the mechanics of blood flow, bone growth, white blood cell response to infections, and biological implications and responses to implants. Skalak was director of Columbia&amp;#39;s Bioengineering Institute from 1978 to 1987. He won numerous significant scientific honors over his career, including election to the National Academy of Engineering in 1988. Columbia Engineering hosts the Richard Skalak Bioengineering Lecture in his honor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.bme.columbia.edu/columbia-bme-seminar-series-2022-2023\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click here to view a list of past Skalak Lectures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT THE 2022-2023 BME SEMINAR SERIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The Department of Biomedical Engineering at Columbia University is proud to host an annual weekly seminar series on the latest developments and research in Biomedical Engineering.

Alongside glittering gold and silver cups, bronze daggers, finely-wrought jewelry, and other precious objects, many ancient graves across the region also contain &amp;lsquo;head and hoof&amp;rsquo; burials &amp;ndash; the skulls and lower limbs of horses or other livestock. While most commonly associated with the royal burials of the Scythians and shamanic practices in Siberia, there is also a long regional tradition of these burials in the South Caucasus in the Bronze Age.

Although a conspiracy of Jews colluding to control publishing in the United States never actually existed, such accusations reflected a genuine transformation from an industry notorious for excluding Jews to one in which they arguably had become the most influential figures.&lt;br /&gt;\\n&lt;br /&gt;\\n&lt;strong&gt;Josh Lambert&lt;/strong&gt; examines the dynamics between Jewish editors and Jewish writers; how Jewish women exposed the misogyny they faced from publishers; and how children of literary parents have struggled with and benefited from their inheritances. Drawing on interviews and tens of thousands of pages of letters and manuscripts, The Literary Mafia offers striking new discoveries about celebrated figures such as Lionel Trilling and Gordon Lish, and neglected fiction by writers including Ivan Gold, Ann Birstein, and Trudy Gertler.&lt;br /&gt;\\n&lt;br /&gt;\\nIn the end, we learn how the success of one minority group has lessons for all who would like to see American literature become more equitable.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Josh Lambert&lt;/strong&gt; is the Sophia Moses Robison Associate Professor of Jewish Studies and English, and director of the Jewish Studies Program, at Wellesley College.

The issues surrounding the missing and their exhumation, identification and burial are some of the lasting legacies of genocide in Bosnia, still affecting many individuals, especially war widows, their families and respective local communities. Dealing with the &amp;lsquo;ambiguous loss&amp;rsquo;, i.e. not knowing where the body of one&amp;rsquo;s loved one is, has made the grieving process of many surviving families much harder than it would be if they had been able to bury the victims. The gaps, absences, and silences the missing persons left behind also reflect upon the politics, culture and reconciliation within the broader Bosnian society and in the diaspora.&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "eileen_huhn", "location": "Hybrid Event", "timestamp": "2023-04-06 18:15:00-04:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "International and Public Affairs"}, {"tagName": "Morningside"}], "attendee": []}

In this talk, I will first briefly introduce the mathematical setup of quantum algorithms, and discuss how to use textbook quantum algorithms to tackle this problem. I will then introduce a new quantum algorithm that can significantly and provably reduce the circuit depth for solving this problem (the reduction can be around two orders of magnitude). This algorithm reduces the requirement on the maximal coherent time for the quantum computer, and can therefore be suitable for early fault-tolerant quantum devices. No prior knowledge on quantum algorithms is necessary for understanding most parts of the talk.&lt;br /&gt;\\n(Joint work with Zhiyan Ding)&lt;br /&gt;\\n&lt;br /&gt;\\nBio: Lin Lin received his B.S. degree in Computational Mathematics from Peking University in 2007, and Ph.D. degree in Applied and Computational Mathematics from Princeton University in 2011, advised by Professor Weinan E and Professor Roberto Car.

After graduating from Matsuyama University of Commerce (Currently Matsuyama University) in 1973 and training at Nishinomiya Shuzo Co., Ltd. (Currently Nihonsakari Co., Ltd.), he joined his family&amp;rsquo;s company Asahi Shuzo in 1976 but left after a conflict with his father. In 1984, Mr. Sakurai returned to the family business after his father&amp;#39;s sudden passing and rebuilt the company by pivoting to focus on the development of Junmai Daiginjo &amp;quot;Dassai.&amp;quot; He has been in his current position since 2016. Mr. Sakurai continues to lead the company&amp;rsquo;s growth by breaking with industry norms through innovative ideas such as four-season brewing by regular employees rather than traditional sake brewers as he persists in his pursuit to produce tasty sake. In April 2018, he opened a joint store with Jo&amp;euml;l Robuchon in Paris, and a brewery in Hyde Park, New York is under construction (scheduled for completion in Spring 2023).

The primary tool employed by the Fed to accomplish this challenging goal is adjustments to the Fed Funds Rate in response to what&amp;rsquo;s happening in the economy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;To combat the recently raging U.S. inflation rate, which is currently at a 40-year high, the Fed has been employing a very aggressive strategy of increasing the Fed Funds Rate to slow down economic activity and bring inflation back in line with historical averages. The magnitude and pace of these rate increases haven&amp;rsquo;t been seen since the 1990s and are having a significant effect on all aspects of the U.S. economy, both the private and public sectors. Banks must carefully manage the impact of rate hikes on the market, credit, and liquidity risks arising from assets and liabilities on their balance sheets. Meanwhile, consumers feel the effects of skyrocketing borrowing costs on their credit card and home mortgage payments. Mortgage rates recently hit a 20-year high, negatively impacting home affordability. On the other hand, higher interest rates also present unique opportunities for financial institutions and consumers who now earn very high yields on deposits and other assets after many years of meager rates.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Our panel of experts from a cross-section of U.S. banks and broker-dealers will discuss the positive and negative impacts of this unique and volatile interest rate environment on financial institutions and consumers and provide their outlook for 2023.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moderator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Michael Leibrock, Managing Director - Chief Systemic Risk Officer and Head of Counterparty Credit Risk, Depository Trust &amp;amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC)&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Panelists&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Anna Bertoni, Senior Director, Consumer Credit Review, Capital One&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Evan Gerhard, President, ASL Capital Markets&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Arthur Laichtman, M.D. Regional Head of Credit, Nomura Securities&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Louis Latona, Senior Portfolio Manager, Treasury, Standard Chartered Bank&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;h4&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-rapid-rise-in-us-interest-rates-registration-505298941737\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;RSVP HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "joshua_gleich", "location": "Online Event", "timestamp": "2023-04-08 17:00:00-04:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Online"}, {"tagName": "Seminar"}], "attendee": []}

Norton &amp;amp; Co. in 2022. Rachel will speak to us about her book, in which she &amp;quot;takes on a herculean task,&amp;quot; according to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;quot;exploring female anatomy from a medical, social and historical perspective... [She takes] readers on an expansive journey across continents, cultures, centuries and even species, [revealing] a stunning disparity in Western medicine and academia: While huge amounts of money and dedication are poured into the understanding of penises, the female body is disregarded. Like lore, this misinformation and shame are still being passed down to girls today.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;In her journalism, Rachel covers the debates and personalities that shape scientific knowledge, most recently as Digital Science Editor for&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Smithsonian Magazine&lt;/em&gt;. In 2016 she launched a special series at Smithsonian to uncover the stories of women scientists who were written out of history. She now tells these stories as a columnist for the BBC Future series &amp;quot;Missed Genius.&amp;quot; In 2019 she received a MacDowell Fellowship to complete research and reporting for her book. Before that she was a 2018-19 Knight Science Journalism Fellow at MIT, where she studied reproductive biology, gender, and history of science. In 2016 she traveled to Germany and Poland as a Journalism Fellow at the FASPE program for the study of professional ethics at Auschwitz. Her writing has appeared in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;WIRED&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;New Scientist&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Undark&lt;/em&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Narrative Medicine Rounds are monthly rounds on the first Wednesday of the month during the academic year hosted by the Division of Narrative Medicine in the Department of Medical Humanities and Ethics at Columbia University Irving Medical Center.

How can we make sense of this statement?

In 2011, the director revisited her 1957 film, adding a new commentary that she reads in voice-over.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;C&amp;eacute;cile Decugis, who was at the time an editor for Godard and Rohmer, among others, was arrested and incarcerated in Paris while working on the editing of Fran&amp;ccedil;ois Truffaut&amp;#39;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Tirez sur le pianiste&lt;/em&gt;, and served several years in the women&amp;#39;s prison of Petite Roquette for aiding the FLN (Algerian National Liberation Front).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Les compagnies de hauts-parleurs et tracts&lt;/em&gt;, unknown director,&amp;nbsp;10 min., 1957, France (Service Cin&amp;eacute;ma des Arm&amp;eacute;es)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Through fictional situations, this film produced by the Service Cin&amp;eacute;ma des Arm&amp;eacute;es offers an effective and humanized image of the French Army, which arrests the &amp;quot;terrorists&amp;quot; (...) but also reconnects with the population and gives them jobs, opens roads, heals, teaches, builds... (c.f.

This documentary describes the methods and strategy of the &amp;quot;psychological warfare&amp;quot; with an enthusiasm and optimism that ultimately proved to be illusory since the war of images was ultimately lost by the colonial power, which ended up negotiating independence with the FLN.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;L&amp;rsquo;arm&amp;eacute;e et le drame alg&amp;eacute;rien&lt;/em&gt;, unknown director,&amp;nbsp;15 min., 1957, France (Service Cin&amp;eacute;ma des Arm&amp;eacute;es)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;As noted by film historian Sebastien Denis, this short instructional film does not conceal the killing of soldiers. It seeks to sharpen the attention of the young recruits by showing them the mistakes to avoid, and by helping them understand the stakes of counter-guerrilla warfare. This type of approach, analyzing counter-insurgency and counter-guerrilla warfare, has served as a matrix for many other conflicts opposing a great military power to a country and a people resorting to &amp;quot;irregular&amp;quot; warfare.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Algeria in Flames&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;em&gt;L&amp;#39;Alg&amp;eacute;rie en flammes&lt;/em&gt;) by Ren&amp;eacute; Vautier,&amp;nbsp;22 min., 1958, Algeria (FLN)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Shot on the side of the FLN and the ALN, it is undoubtedly one of the best known films of the Algerian struggle and the most used in later documentaries (Batty, Stora, Branche...) to depict the struggle of the Algerians. Vautier filmed the life of the ALN fighters, he also shows the way the liberation movement looks after and educates the population, substituting itself for the colonial power and fighting for the Algerians.&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "clara_wilhelm", "location": "Buell Hall, 515 W. 116 St., New York, NY 10027", "timestamp": "2023-01-02 19:00:00-05:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Arts"}, {"tagName": "Humanities"}, {"tagName": "Graduate School of Arts and Sciences"}, {"tagName": "Morningside"}], "attendee": []}

The Council has also served as an early warning system by sounding alarm bells on of impending or worsening crises and has been effective in responding to crises &amp;ndash; both protracted and emerging &amp;ndash; all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;By referring to its different tools and mechanisms, Ambassador Villegas will make the case of the increased relevance of the Human Rights Council at this critical historic moment when we are witnessing the simultaneous occurrence of world shaping events, all of which have huge humanitarian impact and long-lasting consequences: the COVID-19 pandemic (with a weak recovery and the risk of stagflation); climate change and, more recently, the war in Ukraine steaming from the Russian aggression.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ambassador Federico Villegas&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a lawyer and career diplomat.

(1995&amp;ndash;2003), in charge of human rights, cooperation for development and civil society issues.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;In Argentina, at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he was twice Director General of Human Rights (2005&amp;ndash;2007 and 2012&amp;ndash;2015).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Mr. Villegas holds a Master of Arts in Liberal Studies, cum laude, from Georgetown University (1998), and was selected as United Nations Disarmament Fellow in 1994 and Young Leader of the Americas in 2004.

First, I will describe a general theoretical framework for optimal decision-making in dynamic environments, which includes traditional accumulate-to-bound models as a special case but more generally prescribes adaptive processes to interpret, accumulate, and use evidence to form effective decisions. Second, I will describe new findings showing that the primate brain follows many of these adaptive principles to form decisions. Third, I will relate these adaptive decisions to Occam&amp;rsquo;s Razor, including showing evidence that human decisions include a &amp;ldquo;simplicity bias&amp;rdquo; that reflects not just parsimony but also normative principles needed to respond flexibly to real environmental changes while limiting sensitivity to noise.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT THE SPEAKER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joshua Gold, Ph.D.&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Professor of Neuroscience&amp;nbsp;at the University of Pennsylvania&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Joshua Gold is a neuroscientist whose training included studying mechanisms of learning as an undergraduate (with Mark Bear at Brown) and graduate student (with Eric Knudsen at Stanford) and mechanisms of decision-making as a post-doctoral fellow (with Mike Shadlen at the University of Washington).

Scientists, engineers and policy-makers are now facing the daunting task of providing billions of urban citizens with such core necessities as clean energy, air and water.&amp;nbsp; Doing so will undoubtedly require re-thinking the complex relationships, dynamics and interactions between &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;buildings&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;energy&lt;/em&gt; systems in cities. Fortunately, the emergence of new data streams from in-situ sensors (e.g. smart meters) and remote sensors (e.g. mobile phones) as well enhanced access to existing data (e.g. municipal records) enables us to study the complex socio-technical dynamics between people and their urban infrastructure on spatial and time scales previously not possible. This talk will encompass work done by the Stanford Urban Informatics Lab that aims to utilize such data streams to understand the complex interactions between &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;buildings&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;energy&lt;/em&gt; systems across three key decision-making scales (building, community, urban).&amp;nbsp; In doing so, we aim to develop holistic solutions that can enhance the sustainability and energy efficiency of our cities.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Rishee K. Jain is an Assistant Professor of Civil &amp;amp; Environmental Engineering and the Director of the Urban Informatics Lab at Stanford University. His research focuses on the development of data-driven and socio-technical solutions to sustainability problems facing the urban built environment and lies at the intersection of civil engineering, data analytics and social science.&amp;nbsp; He is a recipient of a &lt;em&gt;CAREER &lt;/em&gt;award&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;from the National Science Foundation and a &lt;em&gt;Building Innovator Fellowship &lt;/em&gt;from the Department of Energy.

In the following 130 years, the occupation &amp;ndash;and subsequent annexation&amp;ndash; of Algeria became perhaps the most significant example of European colonialism. Abdelkader&amp;rsquo;s anticolonial resistance, the development of the French &lt;em&gt;mission civilisatrice &lt;/em&gt;and the extensive infrastructure surrounding it, the rise of the F.L.N. and the Algerian war of independence, to name but a few examples, all became well-documented, well-studied episodes in modern colonialism&amp;rsquo;s most emblematic story. What does this all-colonial telling of Algeria&amp;rsquo;s modern history obscure?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Our workshop seeks to address this question by considering the history of the conquest from the point of view of the conquered: the Ottoman province of Algiers. That the Algiers of 1830 had been a province of the Ottoman Empire for over three centuries has been largely ignored by historians of modern Algeria. The speakers of this workshop take as a point of departure the idea that Algeria&amp;rsquo;s colonial history cannot be understood without considering its profound Ottoman entanglements. Looking beyond 1830, we trace the deep continuities that tied colonial Algeria to its &amp;ldquo;precolonial&amp;rdquo; past and reveal the myriad ways Algiers remained Ottoman well after the French conquest. We explore several themes, including the discursive invention of &amp;lsquo;1830&amp;rsquo; and the construction of the precolonial/colonial opposition; local petitions as sites of negotiation for old and new imperial identities; as well as mapping, archive-making, and other technologies of appropriation and re-signification of Algiers&amp;rsquo; Ottoman past.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This event is open to public.

Starting in 1961 as an isolated sect under the leadership of Paul Sch&amp;auml;fer, the colony became notorious for crimes against its inhabitants and the during the military dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet against opponents against the regime.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The transnational history of Colonia Dignidad has linked the Federal Republic of Germany and Chile since the relocation of the sect in 1961. Even after that, Colonia Dignidad residents, often referred to as Colonos, retained German citizenship and maintained close contact with the ethnic German community in Chile and with actors in Germany. Their long existence was made possible by a network of support in both countries. A network of favors, blackmail, and the projection of common interests and ideological convergences secured Colonia Dignidad the support of local officials, government representatives, and actors in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;As part of the project &amp;quot;Colonia Dignidad - A Chilean-German Oral History Archive&amp;quot; 64 life history interviews were conducted with former members of the sect, former political prisoners, relatives of disappeared detainees, Chilean children who suffered sexual violence by Paul Sch&amp;auml;fer in the 1990s and other affected and involved persons. The interviews in German or Spanish were transcribed, translated, and scientifically edited. Thus, a multiperspective interview archive was created, which aims to promote scientific research and political education on the topic through an online platform with protected access.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Speaker:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.lai.fu-berlin.de/en/homepages/rinke/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Stefan Rinke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "ilas", "location": "International Affairs Building, 420 W. 118 St., New York, NY 10027", "timestamp": "2023-01-09 16:10:00-05:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Social Sciences"}, {"tagName": "Humanities"}, {"tagName": "Morningside"}], "attendee": []}

They were data meant to be used, mostly to track plague and other infectious diseases, but also as a source of history. This presentation tracks two state-level death registers, in Milan and Venice, over the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries. Hannah Marcus compares the terms and meanings associated with deaths caused by &amp;ldquo;old age&amp;rdquo; as they morphed over time and varied by context. Like extreme old age itself, this kind of research invites reflection on the place and meaning of exceptionally long lives in unusually turbulent times.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;h3&gt;Event Speaker&lt;/h3&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://histsci.fas.harvard.edu/people/hannah-marcus\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Hannah Marcus&lt;/a&gt;, John and Ruth Hazel Associate Professor of the Social Sciences at Harvard University&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;h3&gt;Event Information&lt;/h3&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This event is free and open to the public; &lt;a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/hannah-marcus-tracking-long-lives-in-early-modern-italy-registration-415429379457\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Registration&lt;/a&gt; required.

The footage shot by different filmmakers and operators (Ren&amp;eacute; Vautier, Djamel Chanderli...) was edited in Belgrade, in ex-Yugoslavia, because it was impossible to do so in France. Conceived as an anti-colonialist plea, advocating for the struggle for independence of the Algerians, as well as for the FLN and the ALN, it is an effective document to testify to the violence of the colonial order (i.e. the repression, the naplam-burned forests, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Die Frage&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;em&gt;The Question&lt;/em&gt;) by Mohand Ali-Yahia,&amp;nbsp;15 min., 1961, Algeria/GDR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This film shot, shot as a graduation project in 35 mm in black and white, by Algerian filmmaker Mohand Ali-Yahia, then a film student in East Berlin, is the first adaptation of Henri Alleg&amp;#39;s famous memoir&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Question&lt;/em&gt;, with an appearance by the author at the end of the film. Sequences of repression meant to represent the Battle of Algiers were shot in Berlin, in the former East Germany, and may have inspired Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo, who had seen this little-known short film before shooting his famous eponymous 1965 feature co-produced by Algeria.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guns of Freedom&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;em&gt;Les Fusils de la Libert&amp;eacute;&lt;/em&gt;) by Djamel Chanderli and Mohamed Lakhdar-Hamina,&amp;nbsp;27 min., 1961, Algeria (GPRA)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The script of this fiction with allegorical overtones was written by Serge Michel, a French journalist who joined the FLN and the GPRA in Tunis. Les fusils de la libert&amp;eacute; (Guns of Freedom) depicts Algerian fighters carrying weapons and ammunition, moving unnoticed among the population in the south of the country. This theme of a &amp;quot;peoples in movement&amp;quot; has been used in several texts and films of the FLN.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;m eight&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;em&gt;J&amp;rsquo;ai huit ans&lt;/em&gt;) by Yann Le Masson and Olga Poliakoff,&amp;nbsp;10 min., 1961, France&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This short film directed by Yann le Masson and Olga Poliakoff (based on an idea of Frantz Fanon) gives voice to Algerian children, war orphans who have taken refuge in Tunisia. They express the shock of war and their sometimes traumatic experience through their drawings, which bear the marks of bombing, combat, resistance and repression.

Lining the ends of long bones, it provides decades of pain free ambulation, a consequence of complex, poroviscoelastic material behavior. However, when cartilage is structurally damaged, osteoarthritis can occur, negatively impacting overall quality of life by reducing mobility. This talk will cover our recent research on mechanics and redox balance of cartilage. Using a microindentation experimental set-up, we induced cartilage fracture across a range of loading rates with altered matrix integrity. This provided insight into the role of poroviscoelastic relaxations in cartilage failure, allowed us to identify a pre-relaxed regime from which we estimated fracture toughness, and allowed the identification of two distinct failure regimes. Using optical redox imaging, we can evaluate cartilage redox balance over time. Our results demonstrate that cartilage redox balance is sensitive to mechanical loading, oxygen tension, and glucose availability, and that redox balance is dynamic. Our studies are the first to evaluate the immediate oxidative-reductive balance in cartilage following mechanical load, providing insight into the effects of physiological and injurious loading that can predispose cartilage to damage. Together, these basic science studies lay foundations for leveraging mechanics to reduce the burden of osteoarthritis. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT THE SPEAKER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corinne Henak, Ph.D.&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Assistant&amp;nbsp;Professor in the Department of Mechanical&amp;nbsp;Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Corinne Henak is an assistant professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, with affiliate appointments in the Department of Orthopedics and Rehabilitation and the Department of Biomedical Engineering. She graduated with a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Denver in 2008 and a PhD in Bioengineering from the University of Utah in 2013. Dr. Henak trained as a post-doc in Biomedical Engineering at Cornell University. The Henak Lab research vision is to drive fundamental knowledge generation and tool development to improve quality of life, specifically focused on the burden of musculoskeletal diseases in humans and animals.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT THE&amp;nbsp;BME SEMINAR SERIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The Department of Biomedical Engineering at Columbia University is proud to host an annual weekly seminar series on the latest developments and research in Biomedical Engineering.

Mark G. Pomar served in senior positions at VOA and RFE/RL from 1982 to 1993, during which time the Reagan and Bush administrations made VOA and RFE/RL an important part of their foreign policy. Pomar takes readers inside the two radio stations to show how the broadcasts were conceived and developed and the impact they had on international broadcasting, U.S.-Soviet relations, Russian political and cultural history, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Pomar provides nuanced analysis of the broadcasts and sheds light on the multifaceted role the radios played during the Cold War, ranging from instruments of U.S. Cold War policy to repositories of independent Russian culture, literature, philosophy, religion, and the arts.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cold War Radio&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;breaks new ground as Pomar integrates his analysis of Cold War radio programming with the long-term aims of U.S. foreign policy, illuminating the role of radio in the peaceful end of the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark G. Pomar&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a senior fellow at the Clements Center for National Security and an adjunct lecturer in the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas. He is a former assistant director of the Russian Service at Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, director of the USSR Division at the Voice of America, and executive director of the Board for International Broadcasting, a federal agency. He served as president and CEO of IREX, an organization that administers programs in education, public policy, and media, and was the founding CEO and president of the U.S.-Russia Foundation in Moscow.

Coercive economic measures such as trade tariffs, financial penalties, and export controls affect large numbers of companies and states across the globe. Some of these penalties target nonstate actors, such as Colombian drug cartels and Islamist terror groups; others apply to entire countries, including North Korea, Venezuela, Iran, and Russia. U.S. policy makers see sanctions as a low-cost tactic, but in reality these measures often fail to achieve their intended goals &amp;mdash; and their potent side effects can harm American interests.&lt;br /&gt;\\n&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\\n&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://cup.columbia.edu/book/backfire/9780231199902\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Backfire&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; the new book by &lt;strong&gt;Agathe Demarais&lt;/strong&gt;, the global forecasting director of the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), explores the surprising ways sanctions affect multinational companies, governments, and ultimately millions of people around the world. Drawing on interviews with experts, policymakers, and people in sanctioned countries, Demarais examines the unintended consequences sanctions can have when used as a diplomatic weapon. The proliferation of sanctions spurs efforts to evade them, as states and firms seek ways to circumvent U.S. penalties. This is only part of the story. Sanctions also reshape relations between countries, pushing governments that are at odds with the U.S. closer to each other &amp;mdash; or, increasingly, to Russia and China.&lt;br /&gt;\\n&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\\nFull of insights spanning a wide range of topics, from Russia&amp;#39;s invasion of Ukraine to Iran&amp;#39;s COVID response and China&amp;#39;s cryptocurrency ambitions, Backfire reveals how sanctions are transforming geopolitics and the global economy &amp;mdash; as well as diminishing U.S. influence. This insider&amp;#39;s account is an eye-opening, accessible, and timely book that sheds light on the future of sanctions in an increasingly multipolar world.&lt;br /&gt;\\n&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\\nJoin the Center on Global Energy Policy and the Center for a New American Security for a fireside chat with Agathe Demarais moderated by &lt;strong&gt;Edward Fishman&lt;/strong&gt;, CGEP Senior Research Scholar, CNAS Adjunct Senior Fellow, and former member of Secretary of State John Kerry&amp;rsquo;s Policy Planning Staff.

An unfamiliar combination of security risks and heavy economic interdependence challenges the standard scholarly menu offered by International Relations. In Global Discord, Paul Tucker, turning to David Hume, lays out principles for a sustainable system of international cooperation that combines realism with sensitivity to our deep political values. Drawing on three decades as a policy maker, Tucker applies these principles to the role of the dollar, the trade and investment regimes, and the financial system.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Join us on November 16 for a panel discussion with:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691229317/global-discord\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Sir Paul Tucker&lt;/a&gt;, Chair of the Systemic Risk Council and Research Fellow at Harvard Kennedy School&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.law.columbia.edu/faculty/petros-c-mavroidis\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Petros Mavroidis&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;Edwin B.

The bare power calculations of states&amp;rsquo; national security, economic and diplomatic interests still present the primary challenge to compliance with human rights norms.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;But threats to the international rights framework are emerging from three new directions: increased geopolitical competition with new powers whose views of state sovereignty are at odds with human rights obligations; the rise of xenophobic and populist domestic movements; and the spread of surveillance technologies. In addition, for billions of citizens living in poverty or conflict zones, the notion of an international legal regime to which they can appeal for the protection of their rights remains a distant fiction.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This book examines the threats to international and regional human rights in Africa, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East.

Developing effective strategies, however, is challenging, due to a variety of factors such as the heterogeneity of the building stock, the decentralization of building policy and data, the high percentage of fossil fuels burned on-premises, and the high necessary investment to retrofit the existing building stock to low-GHG performance. Furthermore, there are serious concerns about increasing inequities from such a low-GHG transition if the direct (e.g., upgrade capital expenses) or indirect (e.g., increased rent) costs were passed onto those most vulnerable in society.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, Dr. Reyna will overview existing and planned efforts by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to provide detailed analysis and data on the impacts of decarbonization to federal, state, and local decision-makers. She will discuss how NREL&amp;rsquo;s ResStock and ComStock tools and their resulting data products can be leveraged by researchers and future key gaps in the building decarbonization space.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Janet L. Reyna is a senior research engineer in the Building Technologies and Sciences Center at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory where she leads development and research with NREL&amp;rsquo;s ResStock tool. Before joining NREL, she was an ORISE Science &amp;amp; Technology Policy Fellow at the DOE Building Technologies Office. Her research interests include assessing the energy and environmental impacts of urban areas at city and regional scales and developing decarbonization strategies for the U.S. building sector. A key goal of Dr. Reyna&amp;rsquo;s research is to provide quantitative information to support policy and decision-making. She has expertise in life cycle assessment, energy forecasting, building stock energy modeling, vehicle emissions simulation, and spatial analysis.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Join Zoom Meeting &lt;a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/j/98152268859?pwd%3DeGRCeVJsN0YvL2JHYlFPUW9FMWxxUT09&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=calendar&amp;amp;ust=1665935708631053&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw03VHI13fStZGm7zzuZgm-Z\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/j/98152268859?pwd=eGRCeVJsN0YvL2JHYlFPUW9FMWxxUT09&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Meeting ID: 981 5226 8859&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Passcode: 279206&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "amoy_ansell-poirier", "location": "Engineering Terrace, 500 W. 120 St., New York, NY 10027", "timestamp": "2023-01-18 11:00:00-05:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Seminar"}, {"tagName": "Morningside"}], "attendee": []}

The tens of thousands of pages of records produced in the course of these trials provide an extraordinarily rich portrait of the role of narcotrafficking in Honduran politics and security forces, and in cross-border businesses and money-flows. A binational team of investigative journalists, Danielle Mackey and Jennifer &amp;Aacute;vila, are building a database to make this information available to journalists, academics, activists, and the general public, as they pursue their own journalistic investigations into the material.

While the multinational Soviet Union was the best-known and most internationally influential product of this milieu, the Bolsheviks were relative latecomers to federalism, drawing upon the established ideas of more moderate and generally overlooked socialist competitors. This presentation offers a glimpse into the international circulation of federal frameworks between late imperial Russia and the wider world, highlighting abortive yet ambitious attempts at incorporating models from Anglophone and German-speaking countries into projects of post-Tsarist order. Following the ideas and travels of Russian-, Ukrainian-, and Polish-speaking socialists, it locates this rich federalist imagination within pan-European and global contexts often elided in conventional Soviet-oriented narratives.&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "eileen_huhn", "location": "International Affairs Building, 420 W. 118 St., New York, NY 10027", "timestamp": "2023-01-18 13:00:00-05:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "International and Public Affairs"}, {"tagName": "Morningside"}], "attendee": []}

A silent epidemic of chronic illnesses afflicts tens of millions of Americans: these are diseases that are poorly understood, frequently marginalized, and can go undiagnosed and unrecognized altogether. In her book, O&amp;rsquo;Rourke delivers a revelatory investigation into this elusive category of &amp;ldquo;invisible&amp;rdquo; illness that encompasses autoimmune diseases, post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, and now long COVID, synthesizing the personal and the universal to help all of us through this new frontier. Drawing on her own medical experiences as well as a decade of interviews with doctors, patients, researchers, and public health experts, O&amp;rsquo;Rourke traces the history of Western definitions of illness, and reveals how inherited ideas of cause, diagnosis, and treatment have led us to ignore a host of hard-to-understand medical conditions, ones that resist easy description or simple cures. And as America faces this health crisis of extraordinary proportions, the populations most likely to be neglected by our institutions include women, the working class, and people of color.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Meghan O&amp;rsquo;Rourke is the author of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;bestseller&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/the-invisible-kingdom-reimagining-chronic-illness/9781594633799\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Invisible Kingdom: Reimagining Chronic Illness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Long Goodbye&lt;/em&gt;, as well as the poetry collections&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Sun In Days&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Once&lt;/em&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Halflife&lt;/em&gt;.

As expressed by Paul Feyerabend in 1975, the maxim &amp;quot;Anything goes&amp;quot; is not a prescriptive exhortation but rather a simple factual observation -- with ample evidentiary support -- of the way science often proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This mini-conference explores the concepts of &amp;#39;serendipity&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;epiphany&amp;#39; within scientific research through an open discourse with a group of scholars from Columbia University and beyond. A group of sympathetic and interested researchers will gather to discuss and present stories, ideas, and explorations that may lead to a wider conversation around these topics. Importantly, a goal for this mini-conference is not to instrumentalize the concepts of serendipity and epiphany, but rather to simply think about them and the conditions that allow them to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;h3&gt;Event Speakers&lt;/h3&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://anthropology.columbia.edu/content/amanda-althoff\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Amanda Althoff&lt;/a&gt;, PhD student in Anthropology at Columbia University&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://anthropology.columbia.edu/content/jeffrey-lee-benjamin\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Jeffrey L.

In&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Free Market: the History of an Idea&lt;/em&gt;, Jacob Soll details how we got to this current crisis, and how we can find our way out by looking to earlier iterations of free market thought. Contrary to popular narratives, early market theorists believed that states had an important role in building and maintaining free markets. But in the eighteenth century, thinkers insisted on free markets without state intervention, leading to a tradition of ideological brittleness. That tradition only calcified in the centuries that followed. Tracing the intellectual evolution of the free market from Cicero to Milton Friedman, Soll argues that we need to go back to the origins of free market ideology in order to truly understand it&amp;mdash;and to develop new economic concepts to face today&amp;rsquo;s challenges.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jacob Soll&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is professor of history and accounting at the University of Southern California. He has been awarded numerous prestigious prizes including two NEH Fellowships, the Jacques Barzun Prize, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and, in 2011, the MacArthur Fellowship. He also advises political and financial leaders across the globe to promote accounting standards and financial transparency.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Joining Jacob Soll to discuss his book will be:&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Pierre Force&lt;/strong&gt;, Professor of French and History at Columbia;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;John Shovlin&lt;/strong&gt;, Professor of History at NYU; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Carl Wennerlind&lt;/strong&gt;, Professor of History at Barnard College.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Emmanuelle Saada&lt;/strong&gt;, Professor of History and French at Columbia, will moderate the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "clara_wilhelm", "location": "Buell Hall, 515 W. 116 St., New York, NY 10027", "timestamp": "2022-11-12 18:00:00-05:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Humanities"}, {"tagName": "Graduate School of Arts and Sciences"}, {"tagName": "Morningside"}], "attendee": []}

This book project considers geopolitical pressures in conjunction with leaders&amp;rsquo; strategic ideas to respond to this question and provides an account of the evolution of the role of Europe in the context of US grand strategy. Observers generally agree on the vague notion that Europe has been deprioritized in Washington&amp;rsquo;s external affairs. Against this background, this book project makes the case that such de-prioritization of Europe in the context of US grand strategy also entails a reconceptualization of the transatlantic relationship, namely as a region featuring long-standing relationships that can at times be leveraged in pursuit of non-European goals. Accordingly, it considers the crucial, yet relatively understudied issue of whether Europe has become indispensable or rather insufferable for the United States in an emerging post-Western world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "saltzman_institute_of_war_and_peace_studies", "location": "International Affairs Building, 420 W. 118 St., New York, NY 10027", "timestamp": "2022-11-13 12:15:00-05:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Social Sciences"}, {"tagName": "International and Public Affairs"}, {"tagName": "Morningside"}], "attendee": []}

State political failures, local negotiations among political and public health leaders, and community (dis)belief about the virus resulted in Okoboji being declared a hotspot just before the Independence Day weekend, when an influx of half a million people visit the town.&lt;br /&gt;\\n&lt;br /&gt;\\nThe story is both personal and political. Author Emily Mendenhall, an anthropologist at Georgetown University, grew up in Okoboji, and her family still lives there. As the events unfolded, Mendenhall was in Okoboji, where she spoke formally with over 100 people and observed a community that rejected public health guidance, revealing deep-seated mistrust in outsiders and strong commitments to local thinking. Unmasked is a fascinating and heartbreaking account of where people put their trust, and how isolationist popular beliefs can be in America&amp;#39;s small communities.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;hr /&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\n&lt;br /&gt;\\nEmily Mendenhall is a medical anthropologist and Professor at the Edmund A.

The reporting exposed the systemic intelligence failings that resulted in countless civilian casualties from U.S.-led airstrikes. And it described the web of impunity that provided cover to those responsible. The series won numerous awards, including a Pulitzer Prize, a National Magazine Award, an Overseas Press Club Award, and a Polk Award.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This talk is part of an OPC series, called, &amp;lsquo;How I Did It,&amp;rsquo; which convenes freelance journalists and their editors or producers to break down a major feat of reporting.

For countries that decide to build new nuclear power plants, most will opt to build reactors supplied by existing vendors, rather than develop domestic designs of their own. A key factor impacting which vendor is chosen to supply reactors to a given country is the associated financing that national governments offer in support of those exports. Russia, the leading vendor of reactors in the world, has supplied billions of dollars of government-backed financing in support of its nuclear exports, as have other vendors from France, South Korea, and China. At some point, the US government will have to decide how it will approach financing US reactor exports in this very competitive environment, and those decisions will impact how much of a role the United States will have in nuclear energy commerce in the coming decades.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The Center on Global Energy Policy will host a panel of experts to discuss the current international landscape for reactor supply, past financing measures by national governments in support of their reactor exports, and current policy-related issues for US decisionmakers to consider.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Moderator:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Bowen&lt;/strong&gt;, Research Scholar, Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University SIPA&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Opening Remarks:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Katy Huff&lt;/strong&gt;, Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy, US Department of Energy&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Panel:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Murphy&lt;/strong&gt;, Managing Director, Murphy Energy &amp;amp; Infrastructure Consulting, LLC&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elizabeth Touomou&lt;/strong&gt;, Commercial Manager, Bechtel Enterprises&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steven Howlett&lt;/strong&gt;, Managing Partner, Horn &amp;amp; Watson Capital Strategies LLC&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This webinar will be hosted via Zoom.

But these visas would have been worthless without Soviet transit visas to cross from Kaunas/Kovno to Vladivostok. Why did Stalin approve this transit, supervised by Molotov, Mikoyan and Beria? How did nearly 4000 Jews travel on 2000 visas? Documents from Soviet and Japanese archives collected, edited and published by Japan&amp;#39;s Slavic-Eurasian Research Center and the Holocaust Research Center in Moscow provide answers to these questions and more.

For a billion people, access to safe drinking water is extremely limited&amp;hellip; creating a global crisis with huge consequences. As a result, millions of families spend their lives trying to get access to water.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Above Water&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;focuses on 12-year-old Houlaye, who lives in a village in Tatis, Niger, and the families and community around her. She walks for several miles with other children every day to fetch water from a well. Water is abundant during the rainy season, but disappears during the dry season. However, two hundred meters below the surface, there is a water source that exceeds their imagination. Houlaye&amp;rsquo;s aunt Suri eventually convinces an NGO to build a well in the village. It brings the promise of a new life for these villagers who, unknowingly, had been above water all along.

This talk focuses on our recent efforts to leverage ML methods to increase our fundamental understanding of the mechanics of living or living-like systems and their unique abilities to adapt to mechanical cues, with a particular emphasis on skin mechanics and mechanobiology. The first project that will be described is skin growth in tissue expansion, a popular reconstructive surgery technique that grows new skin in response to sustained supra-physiological loading. We have created computational models that combine mechanics and mechanobiology to describe the deformation and growth of expanded skin. Together with experiments on a porcine model, and leveraging ML tools such as multi-fidelity Gaussian processes, we have performed Bayesian inference to learn mechanistically how skin grows in response to stretch. Mechanical cues can be key drivers of wound healing pathologies such as fibrosis, but anticipating and controlling scar formation is still out of reach. I will show computational models of reconstructive surgery and wound healing for a murine model of wound healing and in patient-specific cases. Once again, ML methods enable new kinds of analyses such as optimization under uncertainty and inverse parameter calibration which are not achieved with traditional approaches. Lastly, I will discuss other projects in my group and how we are using our understanding of biological systems to create living-like systems with similar capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Buganza-Tepole is an Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Biomedical Engineering (courtesy) at Purdue University. He obtained his Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Stanford University in 2015 and was a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University for a year before joining Purdue as a faculty member in 2016. His group studies the interplay between mechanics and mechanobiology. Using computational simulation, machine learning, and experimentation, his group seeks to characterize the multi-scale mechanics of tissues and understand the fundamental mechanisms of tissue mechano-adaptation in order to improve clinical diagnostics and interventional tools. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Join Zoom Meeting&lt;br /&gt;\\n&lt;a href=\"https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/j/96963261682?pwd=QmZQTjVuWkVOTUcwMm51RmFDRUQ4QT09\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/j/96963261682?pwd=QmZQTjVuWkVOTUcwMm51RmFDRUQ4QT09&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\n&lt;br /&gt;\\nMeeting ID: 969 6326 1682&lt;br /&gt;\\nPasscode: 831798&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "amoy_ansell-poirier", "location": "Mudd Hall, 500 W. 120 St., New York, NY 10027", "timestamp": "2022-11-16 11:00:00-05:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Seminar"}, {"tagName": "Morningside"}], "attendee": []}

But it is the emotional intensity of the film experience and mystical themes of the story that made it into a cult phenomenon and one of France&amp;rsquo;s most commercially successful films.The movie is a heavily fictionalized and dramatized story of the friendship and rivalry between two champion free divers, Jacques Mayol (played by Jean-Marc Barr) and Enzo Maiorca (played by Jean Reno), and Mayol&amp;rsquo;s relationship with his American girlfriend Johanna Baker (Rosanna Arquette).&amp;nbsp;Mayol was a screenwriter for the film, and his search for love, family, &amp;ldquo;wholeness&amp;rdquo; and the meaning of life and death, and the tension between his yearning for the big blue and his relationship with his girlfriend, also form part of the movie&amp;rsquo;s backdrop.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luc Besson&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a French film director, screenwriter, and producer. As writer, director, or producer, Besson has so far been involved in the creation of more than 50 films. When Besson met the great free diver Jacques Mayol, this son of a diving instructor decided to plunge into&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Le Grand Bleu&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;em&gt;The Big Blue&lt;/em&gt;), an ambitious project.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Big Blue&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;dropped anchor at Cannes in 1988. Spectators were immediately swept off into a vertiginous underwater adventure magnified by the music of &amp;Eacute;ric Serra. The film was a unanimous success with spectators, much more so than expected. In France, 9 million viewers rushed to the cinema to see it, making the film a phenomenon that led the press to speak of a &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;g&amp;eacute;n&amp;eacute;ration Grand Bleu&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;To watch trailer please click&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/CWxaxYN7o9A\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This screening is part of Being in the World: People and the Planet in French and Francophone Cinema, a film festival curated and presented by Columbia Maison Fran&amp;ccedil;aise, with additional support provided by Cultural Services of the French Embassy, Columbia Climate School, Knapp Family Foundation, Paul LeClerc Centennial Fund, Columbia University Institute for Ideas and Imagination, Columbia Global Centers | Paris, Society of Fellows and Heyman Center for the Humanities, Alliance Program, and European Institute.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "clara_wilhelm", "location": "Low Library, 535 W. 116 St., New York, NY 10027", "timestamp": "2022-11-16 19:30:00-05:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Humanities"}, {"tagName": "Graduate School of Arts and Sciences"}, {"tagName": "Morningside"}], "attendee": []}

The remarkable SDG Target 4.7 shows us a powerful way forward:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;By 2030 ensure all learners acquire knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including among others through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence, global citizenship, and appreciation of cultural diversity and of culture&amp;rsquo;s contribution to sustainable development.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Mission 4.7, a multi-partner initiative to advance transform education, was launched to put into global practice this bold vision. It underscores that the world must become more prosperous, inclusive, and environmentally sustainable. The world has only until 2030 to fulfill the promise of the SDGs. To do so, current and future generations need to be equipped not just with technical knowledge and skills, but with a deeper understanding of the values needed to forge a peaceful and sustainable future.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Mission 4.7 invites Ministers of Education to join a special Ministerial Panel, a side event of the UN Transforming Education Summit to highlight their work and commitment towards making SDG 4.7 a reality. This Panel will showcase the best practices in countries that are leading the global conversation on transformative education. The Panel will be co-hosted by Mission 4.7 partners UNESCO, the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, the Ban Ki-moon Centre for Global Citizens, and the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University, and feature a keynote speech by Mission 4.7 Patron and former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Event goals:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Promote a more sustainable future for the generations to come from our position as ministers but also as citizens of the countries we come from.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Contribute in policy to help learners of all ages have access to resources related to Transformative Education, Global Citizenship Education, Education for Sustainable Development and all that entails reaching target 4.7.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Use our influence of power to join the global task of helping achieve the SDGs before 2030.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Final comments and thoughts from the Ministerial Panel will be presented to UNESCO&amp;rsquo;s ESD-Net 2030 to inform further global strategy on advancing progress towards SDG 4.7.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Please register on Eventbrite:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ministerial-panel-transformative-education-policy-tickets-406401607147\"&gt;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ministerial-panel-transformative-education-policy-tickets-406401607147&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This event is part of Climate Week NYC.

Towards a hardware-software approach for high-performance databases&lt;/h4&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Jignesh Patel&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;University of Wisconsin-Madison&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;br /&gt;\\nDatabase applications have an insatiable appetite for higher performance. In the past, a large part of this appetite has been fed by leveraging the gift of Moore&amp;rsquo;s Law. The slowing down of Moore&amp;rsquo;s Law now requires a new approach. Fortunately, the hardware landscape is undergoing a Cambrian explosion in new architectures, and in this talk, I will describe how one class of architecture may provide part of the answer in our search for future high-performance database systems. This architecture called PIM, packages compute and storage closely, and appears to be a good candidate to accelerate database analytic workloads. However, as I will describe in this talk, a true hardware-software co-design strategy is needed to engineer critical changes on both sides to achieve high performance. This talk will also highlight how there are rich opportunities in redesigning core database kernels to work with a broader class of hardware by considering circuit-level parallelism that is present in most computing substrates. Finally, I will go back five decades and connect to the early days of the database field when a similar co-design approach (then called database machines) was dominant, and how that history may hold valuable lessons for the path forward.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Bio:&lt;br /&gt;\\nJignesh Patel is a professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison where he also has an affiliate position in the Biostatistics and Medical Informatics department. His research interests are in data management systems. His papers have been selected as best papers in the conference in several top database venues, including SIGMOD and VLDB. He is a Fellow of the AAAS, the ACM, and the IEEE organizations. He has also won teaching awards at the U. Wisconsin and the U. Michigan. He has a keen interest in technology transfer from university research, and he has spun four startups from his research group. Further, at Wisconsin, he has co-founded entrepreneurship organizations at both the department and the university levels to help other entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "daniel_hsu", "location": "Department of Computer Science, 500 W. 120th St., New York, New York 10027", "timestamp": "2022-11-19 11:40:00-05:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Morningside"}], "attendee": []}

The topic is&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Indigenous communities, power, and justice: Climate litigation sustaining South Africa&amp;rsquo;s Wild Coast.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pizza will be served&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Summary:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The Eastern Cape High Court, South Africa has, in December 2021 and September 2022, handed down two landmark decisions in climate litigation aimed at blocking a new Shell fossil fuel development off South Africa&amp;rsquo;s Wild Coast. The climate litigation, led by indigenous communities as part of a broader movement for social, environmental, and climate justice, has been heralded as &amp;ldquo;a victory against capitalist extraction and destruction of humanity&amp;rsquo;s common future&amp;hellip;[and] for the whole planet&amp;rdquo;. This presentation describes and evaluates the two decisions, applying a legal theory of transformative environmental constitutionalism. The theory draws on key aspects of South Africa&amp;rsquo;s transformative constitutional regime and the phenomenon of environmental constitutionalism, which indicates that the environment is a proper subject of protection in constitutional texts and by courts.&amp;nbsp;The presentation reveals the power of rights-based strategies in pursuit of climate justice.&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "kemi_adetayo", "location": "Columbia Law School, 435 W. 116 St., New York, NY 10027", "timestamp": "2022-11-20 12:10:00-05:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Morningside"}], "attendee": []}

She received her PhD in political science from the University of California, San Diego in 2021. Her research focuses on the political economy of natural resources and environmental politics, with a focus on Latin America. She is originally from Chile, where she received her BA and Ms in Economics at PUC-Chile and worked as an anti-trust economist at the Fiscalia Nacional Economica before embarking on her PhD at UCSD. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paper Abstract: &lt;/strong&gt;Women have been shown to have different policy preferences, invest in different types of goods and be less corrupt than men when elected into political office. In this paper, we study the effects of electing a woman mayor into office in Brazil on rates of deforestation, the main source of carbon emissions in Brazil. We exploit a close election regression discontinuity design in order to establish causal findings. We find that electing a woman mayor leads to significantly lower deforestation rates during the woman&amp;#39;s time in office. We propose that women&amp;#39;s effect on reduced deforestation comes through two mechanisms: (i) women&amp;#39;s distinct preferences towards climate change and (ii) a lower likelihood of being captured or corrupt. Although we can&amp;#39;t fully differentiate between the mechanisms, we provide evidence that the capture mechanism is certainly at play. Women mayors are less corrupt than their male counterparts, receive less campaign funding, and are less likely to receive funding or have ties to the agricultural and mining sectors. Additionally, we study how women&amp;#39;s actions lead to lower deforestation rates by looking at whether women mayors impose more environmental fines and embargoes (a sign of better monitoring and enforcement), whether they are also able to reduce the number of fires in their municipalities, and whether there are fewer instances of land related conflict inside their municipalities. Altogether, our findings strongly support the theory that women&amp;#39;s representation reduces deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon, with evidence that lower likelihood of regulatory capture and corruption levels are driving these results, at least in part.&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "ilas", "location": "International Affairs Building, 420 W. 118 St., New York, NY 10027", "timestamp": "2022-11-20 13:00:00-05:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Social Sciences"}, {"tagName": "Humanities"}, {"tagName": "Morningside"}], "attendee": []}

On the one hand, we will work on defining and setting expectations for student engagement, as well as building strategies within the framework of active learning in order to provide both a theoretical and a practical approach to the challenge of creating significant learning experiences intentionally and productively. On the other hand, we will look more specifically at how instructors can harness the language of growth in the classroom when providing feedback on student engagement as another mechanism to center equity in the learning space, thus building resources to metalinguistically reflect on our own teaching lexicon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This two-part Learning Community will meet in-person&lt;/strong&gt; and is designed and facilitated by Tamara Hache and Laura DiNardo, Senior Lead Teaching Fellows at the Center for Teaching and Learning.

This has led to an increased demand for these climate services, not only in the food-security community but also in energy, public health and other sectors. In a similar fashion, ACToday teams trained thousands of staff at national ministries, agriculture extension services and research institutions to become more sophisticated users of climate information for decision making.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Come learn about the foundational changes ACToday was able to make that will continue to transform approaches to achieving food security in each country for years.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;A detailed agenda and speaker list will be posted shortly.

Spatial transcriptomics has recently emerged as a key technique to capture and positionally barcode RNAs directly in tissues. Today, I will present the recent advances in the application of spatial transcriptomics at scale, by presenting Spatial Multi-Omics (SM-Omics) as a fully automated, high-throughput all-sequencing based platform for combined and spatially resolved transcriptomics and antibody-based protein measurements. SM-Omics uses DNA-barcoded antibodies, immunofluorescence or a combination thereof, to scale and combine spatial transcriptomics and spatial antibody-based multiplex protein detection.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt; Dr. Vickovic is currently the Director of Technology Innovation and a Core Faculty at the New York Genome Center and Assistant Professor&amp;nbsp;of Biomedical Engineering (in the Herbert and Florence Irving Institute for Cancer Dynamics) at Columbia University as well as a Wallenberg Academy Fellow of the Royal Academy of Sciences and Royal Academy of Engineering at Uppsala University. Dr. Vickovic received her PhD in Genetics from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. Following her graduate work, Dr. Vickovic joined the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard as a Wallenberg Fellow. Dr. Vickovic pioneered novel spatially resolved transcriptomics and genomics methods that enable massively parallel in situ profiling of intact tissue samples. She has vast experience in spatial and single cell genomics, data analysis and software implementations with focus on developing accessible genomic methods for use in clinics.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "lorenza_favrot", "location": "On Campus", "timestamp": "2022-11-21 14:00:00-05:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Seminar"}, {"tagName": "Morningside"}], "attendee": []}

Whether you can change your legal sex to &amp;ldquo;F&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;M&amp;rdquo; (or more recently &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo;) depends on what state you live in, what jurisdiction you were born in, and what government agency you&amp;rsquo;re dealing with.

Noting the immense difficulty of keeping delicate plants like citrus and palms alive over long, volatile oceanic trips, Ellis&amp;mdash;a Linnaean correspondent and natural goods merchant&amp;mdash;suggested the use of another less &amp;ldquo;valuable&amp;rdquo; plant in safely cushioning objects within wooden crates: moss. Small, soft, and readily available in most environments on every continent, moss proved more successful than other packing materials in successfully transporting plants from and between colonies during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and was quickly adopted by naturalists around the world. Moss, though, also required diligent collection before it could be used to preserve other plants. Examining the small industry of identifying and collecting moss for shipping purposes, Elaine Ayers unravels the networks of skilled observation and field-based labor sustained by working-class colonial servants and Indigenous communities necessary in maintaining and driving colonial botany. Questioning the construction of &amp;ldquo;value&amp;rdquo; in collecting guides like Ellis&amp;rsquo;s and in desiderata lists written by prominent naturalists back in Europe, she suggests that moss, in all of its miniscule mundanity, fueled colonial preservational practices while exposing the racial and class-based complexities of collecting on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;h3&gt;Event Speaker&lt;/h3&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://gallatin.nyu.edu/people/faculty/ema326.html\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Elaine Ayers&lt;/a&gt;, Visiting Assistant Professor at New York University&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;h3&gt;Event Information&lt;/h3&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This event is free and open to the public; &lt;a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/elaine-ayers-three-inches-deep-of-wet-moss-registration-412420239037\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Registration&lt;/a&gt; required.

But the continent is also at the forefront of the climate crisis, with temperatures rising faster there than anywhere else on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Only by rapidly scaling climate-smart agriculture can African farmers produce enough nutritious food that supports decent livelihoods and resilient communities in ways that limit greenhouse gas emissions and reverse the degradation of nature.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;By doing so, the world can diversify food supply, limit acute hunger and alleviate inflationary pressures.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This event will bring together speakers from the worlds of politics, science, social activism, and journalism to collectively craft a common message on what Africa&amp;rsquo;s global partners need to deliver at UNGA and COP27.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;AICCRA helps deliver a climate-smart African future driven by science and innovation in agriculture. In this event, attendees will understand how fifty years of innovation led by CGIAR&amp;mdash;the world&amp;rsquo;s largest research partnership for food security&amp;mdash;is only just the beginning, and how projects like AICCRA go beyond innovation, working with hundreds of partners to scale and deploy innovation so that it reaches smallholder farmers be they women, men or youth.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Columbia Climate School and the many initiatives and centers it hosts&amp;mdash;including the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI)&amp;mdash;are indispensable partners for the science and research that supports climate-smart agriculture worldwide.

The CLCPA will require siting and developing a very large number of major renewable energy projects at an unprecedented pace throughout New York State.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;To achieve its mandate under the CLCPA, in 2020, New York State enacted a landmark siting law, the Accelerated Renewable Energy Growth and Community Benefit Act.The siting law created a new Office of Renewable Energy Siting (ORES) to conduct a &amp;quot;coordinated and timely review&amp;quot; of all major renewable energy projects in a cost-effective and environmentally responsible manner.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Please join the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School and the Columbia Climate School for a discussion on ORES&amp;#39;s progress implementing the new siting process over the last two years and other stakeholder perspectives.The event will feature a 30-minute discussion with Houtan Moaveni, Executive Director of ORES, followed by a 90-minute panel discussion with:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;-Audrey Friedrichsen, Senior Climate and Renewable Energy Attorney at Scenic Hudson&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;-Cullen Howe, Senior Renewable Energy Advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC)&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;-Anne Reynolds, Executive Director of the Alliance for Clean Energy New York (ACE NY)&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;-Noah Shaw, Partner at Foley Hoag LLP and former General Counsel of NYSERDA&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.climateweeknyc.org/events/siting-renewables-new-york-ambitious-climate-goals-new-siting-process-and-how-it-going\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Climate Week 2022 event&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;will be moderated by Matthew Eisenson, Attorney, Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJIvcOqgqjMsGtHxHHW4-NVK5KioeJJdjPHH\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;PLEASE REGISTER HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This event is part of Climate Week NYC.

The documentary was filmed before the war, but it sheds light on the roots of this ambivalent attitude. Serbian high school graduates get together, 30 years later, in their former Belgrade classroom. They finished school in 1989. It was the year of the fall of the Berlin Wall, and their horizons seemed wide open towards Europe and the world. But instead, the Yugoslav wars broke out. What&amp;#39;s left today of the broken dreams of this generation? Their country, Serbia, is part of the so-called &amp;ldquo;Western Balkans,&amp;quot; a grey spot on the map of Europe. Not only have the Western Balkans not yet become part of the European Union, but today we are talking about a possible return to the conflicts and wars seen during the 1990s. What went wrong? The spotlight of the story is on Serbia, the author&amp;rsquo;s home country. Through conversations with former classmates and questions from his daughter growing up in Brussels, the author tries an introspection of what has happened in the past 30 years. Today, in 2022, the Serbian society is still entangled in some of the issues that already plagued it back in 1989: Kosovo, relations with its neighbors, the EU perspective, the state of democracy. Has the author&amp;#39;s generation missed the historic opportunity to anchor Serbia in the European fold?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;h2&gt;Ways to Attend&lt;/h2&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;In-person:&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Reserve Your Seat&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(see button below)&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "eileen_huhn", "location": "International Affairs Building, 420 W. 118 St., New York, NY 10027", "timestamp": "2022-11-22 18:30:00-05:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "International and Public Affairs"}, {"tagName": "Morningside"}], "attendee": []}

In tandem, thermal properties play an outsize role in determining the overall performance of these technologies. Engineering improved performance thus requires the ability to visualize heat flow using non- invasive thermometry techniques with nanoscale spatial resolution. Conventional far-field optical techniques enable non-contact measurements, but such approaches fundamentally lack the spatial resolution required to resolve nanoscale temperature heterogeneities. This talk will introduce two novel approaches to overcome this challenge. The first portion of the talk will cover high-resolution single-point temperature measurements based on the luminescence emitted by an individual nanoparticle placed precisely at the location of interest using atomic force microscope nanomanipulation. The second portion will present progress towards an optical super-resolution nanothermometry technique that allows for continuous temperature mapping with nanoscale spatial resolution.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Andrea Pickel received her B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University (2014) and her Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley (2019), where she was supported by a National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship and a UC Berkeley Chancellor&amp;rsquo;s Fellowship. She then joined the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Rochester as an Assistant Professor. Current research in her group focuses on leveraging the unique properties of luminescent materials to develop nanothermometry techniques with exceptional spatial and temporal resolution and thermal metrology for use at high temperatures and in harsh chemical environments.

This presentation will describe studies examining the influence of biomaterials on stem cell behavior with an emphasis on identifying biomaterial properties and designs that impart appropriate cues to stem cells and other cell types to affect their behavior both &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. Recent results using bioinspired materials, specifically piezoelectric materials that provide electromechanical cues to stem cells and other cell types, will be presented.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;In new work, protein-based biomaterials were processed to become piezoelectric and properties tuned to affect cell behavior. Findings demonstrating stem cell differentiation and tissue formation using novel glycosaminoglycan mimetics, which are polysaccharides that sequester and prolong the bioactivity of growth factors, will be presented.

She decides to launch an independent TV station in Putin&amp;rsquo;s Russia. Natasha hires opposition reporters and minorities, as well as LGBTQ community members to work on this project.

Rouqier concentrates on his ancestral family&amp;rsquo;s farm in the Rouergue, following the family and their neighbors through the cyclical changes of the four seasons. Richard Brody praises&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Farrebique&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and its 1983 sequel&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Biquefarre&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;as &amp;ldquo;two outstanding works of world cinema that hardly get discussed because of their general unavailability.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Farrebique&lt;/em&gt;, a &amp;ldquo;classic hybrid of fiction and nonfiction and classic work of dramatic sociology,&amp;rdquo; uses non-professional actors playing out a fictional family drama filmed in their real-life setting. Rouquier meticulously and faithfully documents the material life (clothing, gaslit interior, furnishings, tools), and daily gestures (making bread, cooking over the open hearth, darning socks and telling stories around the evening fire, plowing the field) of a peasant family just before the post-war transformation of French society that would rapidly modernize farming practices and lifestyles in rural France.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grand prix du Cin&amp;eacute;ma Fran&amp;ccedil;ais&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grand prix international de la critique - Cannes 1946&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Georges Rouquier&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1909-1989) is sometimes seen as the successor to the Robert Flaherty tradition of documentary filmmaking, but also, because of the context in which his first feature was released, as a champion of a specifically French neo-realism which paved the way for the French New Wave a decade later. Coming to Paris from the rural provinces, and getting a job as a linotypist, he spent much of his free time frequenting movie theaters where silent classics by the great Russian and Swedish directors were shown. Returning to his roots in the Rouergue to film the farming seasons in the mid-1940s, his feature caused controversy at the Cannes festival but was appreciated by others around the same time that Italian films were also experimenting with using real locations and some non-professional actors, so his work was picked up for U.S. distribution. In 2009, the French Cin&amp;eacute;matheque honored him with a retrospective.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;To watch trailer please click&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i0B0ZMm26E\"&gt;&amp;nbsp;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard Pe&amp;ntilde;a&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a Professor of Film Studies at Columbia University, where he specializes in film theory and international cinema.

His first feature &lt;em&gt;Igla&lt;/em&gt; (The Needle, 1988) initiated what was to become in cinematic history: the &amp;quot;Kazakh New Wave&amp;quot;. Claiming recognition at festivals including Berlin (world premiere), Toronto and Sundance, the film was released in the USSR in 1989 with the resulting box office number of 15.5 million admissions. His second feature &lt;em&gt;Diki Vostok&lt;/em&gt; (The Wild East, 1993), shot during the breakup of the USSR and presented as the &amp;quot;last Soviet film,&amp;quot; won acclaim in venues spanning from Venice (world premiere) to Los Angeles to Tokyo. Teaching, writing and directing, he has authored Dramaticon, an original screenwriting method. In 2015-2017, Nougmanov served as General Director of the Eurasia International Film Festival, accredited by the FIAPF. Currently, he serves as President of the National Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences of Kazakhstan. &lt;em&gt;Batu: Historical Detective&lt;/em&gt; (2022) is his long-anticipated comeback as innovative filmmaker.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;h2&gt;Ways to Attend&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_0hfBU9VfQIKSz5VYbgx33g\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Register for Zoom Webinar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/CIt4VQcm7mQ\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Watch on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;In-person:&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Reserve Your Seat&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(see button below)&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "eileen_huhn", "location": "Hybrid Event", "timestamp": "2022-11-27 18:30:00-05:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "International and Public Affairs"}, {"tagName": "Morningside"}], "attendee": []}

Check out our &lt;a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/votingweek/?hl=en\"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/votingweek/\"&gt;Facebook &lt;/a&gt;to stay posted on what we&amp;rsquo;re up to. You can get involved by reaching out to &lt;a href=\"mailto:cuvotingweek@gmail.com\"&gt;cuvotingweek@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Voting Week began as the idea of former Columbia Political Union president David Kang &amp;#39;15. Kang envisioned a weeklong celebration of civic engagement on campus to drum up voter registration and political awareness at Columbia. In the years since, Voting Week has offered the Columbia community perspectives from a vast range of backgrounds to discuss democracy around the world, civic engagement in the United States, and issues around voting. The Voting Week committee recognizes that many members of the Columbia community are not able to vote in U.S. elections, and has strived to also offer learning experiences and opportunities for civic engagement that do not depend upon one&amp;rsquo;s ability to vote.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;During the week, student volunteers help members of the community file for absentee ballots and register to vote. Voting Week has been proud to host speakers including Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee, New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson, New York City Mayor David Dinkins, Prime Minister of Iraqi Kurdistan Barham Salih, and many other distinguished guests. Voting Week has also successfully registered hundreds of students to vote in their home districts.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Columbia Voting Week wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be here if not for our dedicated committee!&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Co-Chairs: &lt;/strong&gt;Easten Young and Nina Liloia&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marketing and Communications Manager&lt;/strong&gt;: Ria Mavinkurve&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Committee Members&lt;/strong&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Anusha Merchant&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Anushka Pai&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Beatrix Holstine&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Charlie Bonkowsky&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Charlotte Hoskins&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Emma Sherman-Hawver&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Grant Baxter&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Ileane Barrrea&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Jamie Baker&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Lucy King&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Matias Hernandez&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Michelle Chen&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Nicole Wong&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Yeibin Andrews&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Register to Vote&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://turbovote.org/name\"&gt;Register to vote on TurboVote&lt;/a&gt;.

Nonetheless, institutions who seek to buy or sell large amounts of stock may stick out in the crowd and fall victim to predatory behavior.

In this talk, I&amp;#39;ll describe why cryptographers and computer scientists are well-suited to approach this problem, and why more public research would be good for the health of the financial industry.

On the one hand, we will work on defining and setting expectations for student engagement, as well as building strategies within the framework of active learning in order to provide both a theoretical and a practical approach to the challenge of creating significant learning experiences intentionally and productively. On the other hand, we will look more specifically at how instructors can harness the language of growth in the classroom when providing feedback on student engagement as another mechanism to center equity in the learning space, thus building resources to metalinguistically reflect on our own teaching lexicon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This two-part Learning Community will meet in-person&lt;/strong&gt; and is designed and facilitated by Laura DiNardo and Tamara Hache, Senior Lead Teaching Fellows at the Center for Teaching and Learning.

Through a 5-week interactive curriculum, this group aims to begin to equip students with the time, space, and skills for the self-reflection and processing of privilege that is necessary to meaningfully dismantle systems of racial oppression from a position that has privilege. Through increasing self-awareness and centering justice, as well as the recognition of history and its impact on the present, students will build skills around empathy, responsibility in action, and interrogation of knowledges we use and value while centering compassion, healing, and vulnerable, open dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This space will not be a support group for white students. Nor will it be comfortable or easy. What it will be is a meaningful, challenging step for those who feel called in and ready to start taking their appropriate place in creating a more just Columbia community.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;*Due to the open and online nature of this virtual working group where building community and relationships that invite accountability are central to the success and sustainability of this effort for everyone, we ask that you be able to attend all 5 sessions.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;*Although this space is not private or confidential, participants are asked to be respectful and mindful of each other and practice discretion.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;*Please email Alice!

It has also darkened the prospects for natural gas, especially in developing markets where it was to play a central role in energy transitions.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Natural gas demand is now expected to decline in 2022 and remain subdued until 2025. Europe&amp;rsquo;s pursuit of LNG to phase out Russian pipeline gas &amp;ndash; combined with limited additions of new LNG export capacity &amp;ndash; raise the risk of a prolonged market tightness and periodic shortages of natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Scaling up low-carbon gas production, the abatement of methane emissions and a faster implementation of clean energy transition policies in developed economies could help ease price competition and free up gas for price-sensitive emerging markets, where gas can deliver short-term improvements in carbon intensity and air quality by accelerating the transition away from coal.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The Center on Global Energy Policy will host a panel of experts to discuss the latest Q3 2022 edition of the IEA&amp;rsquo;s Gas Market Report, which provides a medium-term forecast to 2025 and a short-term update on recent gas market developments in the first half of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Moderator:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Anne-Sophie Corbeau, Global Research Scholar, Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University SIPA&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Panelists:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Akos Losz, Energy Analyst, International Energy Agency&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Leslie Palti-Guzman, Co-Founder and CEO, GasVista&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Tom Marzec-Manser, Head of Gas Analytics, ICIS&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This webinar will be hosted via Zoom.

One task that intersects these three realizations is mentoring. Mentorship is often uncompensated and undervalued; it is also an easy task to be cut when our plates are full. Most professionals are interested in mentorship -- to help others and to create a sense of purpose. But can we do this meaningfully with limited time, energy, knowledge? In this lecture, you will learn how to mentor efficiently. You will learn to protect yourself before and while you help others. You will learn that by implementing deliberate strategies, you become more engaged with your job. As a byproduct of the lecture, you will also learn how to become a better mentee as well. This lecture will review some data, some theories, some anecdotes. But it will otherwise be largely strategic.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Columbia is an institutional member of the National Center for Faculty Development &amp;amp; Diversity (NCFDD).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ol&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Activate your free membership here:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/columbiaNCFDD\"&gt;https://tinyurl.com/columbiaNCFDD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facultydiversity.org/webinars/mentorshippractices\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REGISTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;on the NCFDD website.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ol&gt;", "organizerId": "marianna_pecoraro", "location": "Online", "timestamp": "2022-09-19 14:00:00-04:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Online"}], "attendee": []}

Knowing R basics is beneficial to maximize training from the boot camp, but is not necessary for you to strongly engage with training material.

Such inconsistency has been heightened in the wake of the pandemic. For instance, in &amp;lsquo;normal&amp;rsquo; times, women were already more likely to perform service work for their departments. Women generally spend more time on teaching, mentoring students, and performing &amp;ldquo;invisible labor.&amp;rdquo; And, many faculty members, particularly at the rank of associate professor, take on leadership roles and contribute to university governance. Most often such work is not recognized in the typical faculty-reward structure leading to stagnation of those faculty at the lower ranks of the professoriate. These issues have implications for individual faculty aspirations and institutional goals to build leadership skills and diversify university leadership. This webinar will address the following questions: How do we incorporate contributions to service and leadership into faculty success and excellence to enable promotion? What forms of service meet individual faculty aspirations and institutional goals especially for building leadership skills? The webinar will benefit faculty, promotion committees, and other administrators.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Columbia is an institutional member of the National Center for Faculty Development &amp;amp; Diversity (NCFDD).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ol&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Activate your free membership here:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/columbiaNCFDD\"&gt;https://tinyurl.com/columbiaNCFDD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.facultydiversity.org/webinars/makingthecasewk2\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REGISTER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;on the NCFDD website.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ol&gt;", "organizerId": "marianna_pecoraro", "location": "Online", "timestamp": "2022-10-03 14:00:00-04:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Online"}], "attendee": []}

Towards a hardware-software approach for high-performance databases&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Computer Science Distinguished Lecture Series&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Jignesh Patel, University of Wisconsin-Madison&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;br /&gt;\\nDatabase applications have an insatiable appetite for higher performance. In the past, a large part of this appetite has been fed by leveraging the gift of Moore&amp;rsquo;s Law. The slowing down of Moore&amp;rsquo;s Law now requires a new approach. Fortunately, the hardware landscape is undergoing a Cambrian explosion in new architectures, and in this talk, I will describe how one class of architecture may provide part of the answer in our search for future high performance database systems. This architecture, called PIM, packages compute and storage closely, and appears to be a good candidate to accelerate database analytic workloads. However, as I will describe in this talk, a true hardware software co-design strategy is needed to engineer critical changes on both sides to achieve high performance. This talk will also highlight how there are rich opportunities in redesigning core database kernels to work with a broader class of hardware by considering circuit-level parallelism that is present in most computing substrates. Finally, I will go back five decades and connect to the early days of the database field when a similar co-design approach (then called database machines) was dominant, and how that history may hold valuable lessons for the path forward.&lt;br /&gt;\\n&lt;br /&gt;\\nBio&lt;br /&gt;\\nJignesh Patel is a professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison where he also has an affiliate position in the Biostatistics and Medical Informatics department. His research interests are in data management systems. His papers have been selected as best papers in the conference in several top database venues, including SIGMOD and VLDB.

While traditional security (e.g., encryption) prevents unauthorized access tomessage content, detection of the mere presence of a message by the adversary can havea significant negative impact. This necessitates the use of covert communication, which notonly protects the information contained in a transmission from unauthorized decoding, butalso prevents the detection of a transmission in the first place. Although practical radio-frequency covert communication systems have been around since the advent of spread-spectrum, exploration of their fundamental limits is a new direction in information theory.Surprisingly, analysis of covert communication systems reveals that, while the Shannoncapacity of a covert communication channel is zero, it still allows transmission of a largevolume of covert data. This is true even when covert communications are secure fromdetection by a quantum-enabled adversary.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will present these fundamentalresults, focusing on their intuitive explanation, rather than their mathematical derivations. Iwill also describe a table-top proof-of-concept validation that paved the way for the ongoingexperimental studies in quantum-secure covert communication.&lt;br /&gt;\\n&lt;br /&gt;\\nBio: Boulat A.

The forum will help inform the audience of the state of various technologies, their prospects to make further contributions to the energy mix, and how these technologies should be further invested in, from basic discovery through deployment.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The discussion will focus on the state of advanced nuclear development and policies that have been helpful to getting the sector to today&amp;rsquo;s position.

What happens when our approach to public health doesn&amp;#39;t make room for all of who we are?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;In this panel discussion, we&amp;#39;ll explore intersectionality&amp;mdash;the simultaneous effects of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and other social and personal categories of identity.

This Cas13d-mediated target RNA knockdown can be superior to existing DNA-targeting CRISPR technologies, enabling unambiguous targeting of non-coding RNAs, RNA isoforms, or RNA viruses; and delivery of multiple guide RNAs (gRNAs) at the same time. Here, I am highlighting the utility of Cas13d for the scientific community, first by thoroughly defining the requirements for gRNA design and by developing a pipeline for transcriptome-wide forward genetic pooled screens. And finally, by combining the high throughput of pooled Cas13 screens with content-rich phenotyping of single-cell perturbation approaches to study genetic interactions with multimodal readout.&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "stuart_fischer", "location": "Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, 1130 St. Nicholas Ave., New York, NY 10032", "timestamp": "2022-05-02 16:00:00-04:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Seminar"}], "attendee": []}

Where do our best ideas come from? Join us for a conversation with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://columbiasocialenterprise.org/civicrm/mailing/url?u=37727&amp;amp;qid=\"&gt;Professor Sheena Iyengar&lt;/a&gt;, who will touch on how innovation &amp;mdash; whether that be as an environmental entrepreneur, within a business or field of discipline, or in our personal lives and how we impact the environment &amp;mdash; begins with a creative spark and the tools that can be used to find your spark of innovation to address the global climate change crisis.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The Think Bigger Innovation Method utilizes decision-making theory, cognitive science, and industry practice to facilitate creativity and innovation for complex problem solving that is both novel and useful. Using cognitive science, Think Bigger provides a six-step method for innovation that is unlike any other. Whether a problem is related to social discourse, the transition to net zero, or supply chain sustainability and logistics, The Think Bigger Innovation Method fosters both interdisciplinary teamwork and constructive interactions that draw on every individual&amp;rsquo;s experience and expertise. The method focuses on defining and refining a problem, while learning to deconstruct and verbalize that problem to surface and reduce bias. It also privileges searching outside the self, going far beyond customer insight, and exploring the history of true innovation. At its heart, Think Bigger relies on structured persistence, multi-domain research, and combinatory experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://columbiasocialenterprise.org/civicrm/event/register?id=849&amp;amp;reset=1\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RSVP &amp;rarr;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;", "organizerId": "tamer_center_for_social_enterprise", "location": "Online", "timestamp": "2022-05-02 18:30:00-04:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Online"}], "attendee": []}

From local government initiatives in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to renewed discussions about an HR 40 Bill at the federal Congress level, redress for centuries of racialized forms of violence is on the public and official political agenda.&lt;br /&gt;\\n&lt;br /&gt;\\nIn this panel, scholars of redress will discuss the trajectory of the reparations movement in the U.S., as well as explore enduring barriers to reparatory justice. We will furthermore examine methods for rectifying systemic inequality that has resulted from past and ongoing forms of racial discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The Amendment Project (TAP) is a student-led organization seeking to drive young people to join the movement for reparations. Through city-council level campaigns like the one in Tulsa in 2021 and workshops hosted with organizations like the ACLU and university and high school organizations, TAP works to mobilize through student lobbying and providing educational resources on reparations in a modern context.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speakers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- Katherine M.

Sovereignty, soliloquy, sonnet (sonata), (in)sovereignty, sound, sequence (sequins), syncopation and self(lessness) are all over our minds because of Henry V or, as his friends call him, Hank Cinq. In addition to lisps becoming more naked and emphatic with every hissing breath, certain obsessions of, which these words bear, become more apparent as well. The obsessions are physical and sociological problems, which will fall under the rubric of chance and incalculability and we&amp;rsquo;ll need some guidance (from W. E. B. Du Bois and Stephen Booth) to be able to discern how indeterminacy and unruliness are the heart of the matter of the sonnet and their non-binary sister, the soliloquy. We might begin to consider the force of the solo in the soliloquy but if we do it&amp;rsquo;s because that force is the sound of the unalone and the non-aligned. The single-line&amp;rsquo;s striational transgression of the line is itself striated, an involuntary muscular shredding of the sonnet that might be said to operate as a kind of anticipatory anti-coloniality in the sonnet, a resistance to constraint and control, Hank&amp;rsquo;s revelation and undoing of himself, which it is ours to deepen, extend, and swing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This event is free and open to everyone but registration is required.

It is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that impacts societies in multiple ways. It affects the development of democracies and the rule of law, weakens government institutions, hinders economic growth, degrades the environment, and ramp up the violation of human rights. The transnational flow of people, materials, and information has remarkably increased the levels of interactions at different spatial and administrative scales. Consequently, large networks of interrelated players across borders developing complex corruption structures and schemes are seen in cases such as the Pandora Papers or Odebrecht, while national corruption scandals involving business, shell companies, government officials, and political parties are equally escalated in many countries of the Americas.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;In a more connected world than ever, larger amounts of data and information are also produced massively from various sources, ranging from journalism, civil society organizations, oversight agencies, and government. Nevertheless, political use of criminal justice, constant budget cutbacks to prosecution and accountability institutions, degradation of operation capacity, and selective austerity policies pose new challenges for intelligence, prosecution, and policymaking.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This conference addresses a regions&amp;#39; paradox: while more sophisticated national and transnational corruption schemes expand, the institutional capacities of governments to prevent and combat corruption are being eroded. What should innovative anti-corruption strategies look like, and what are the key influential actors in this context?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Speakers:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Sergio L&amp;oacute;pez Ayll&amp;oacute;n, CIDE, Mexico.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Roberto Saba, Unversidad de Palermo, Argentina.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Cristian Priscoff, University of Chile, Chile.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Peniley Ram&amp;iacute;rez, NYC-based Journalist.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Carmen Elo&amp;iacute;sa Ruiz, Externado University, Colombia&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Vladimir Aras, Federal Appelate Prosecutor, Brasil&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Moderators:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Hugo Concha, IIJ-UNAM&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Issa Luna-Pla, Visiting Scholar at Columbia University&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJIude6prD4qEtS_w-5z18kHGRjrpQ-l2qch&nbsp;\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Click here to register.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "ilas", "location": "Online", "timestamp": "2022-05-04 09:00:00-04:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Social Sciences"}, {"tagName": "Online"}, {"tagName": "Humanities"}, {"tagName": "International and Public Affairs"}], "attendee": []}

Our laboratory uses this &amp;ldquo;whisking&amp;rdquo; behavior as a model to study how animal nervous systems actively gather and process complex sensorimotor information. There are no sensors along the length of each whisker, so a whisking animal must form a three-dimensional (3D) tactile impression of the environment based on mechanical signals at the whisker bases. In this talk, I will describe studies that examine how a rodent might use information about whisker bending to extract the 3D contour of an object, and how primary sensory neurons of the trigeminal ganglion (Vg) represent these mechanical signals. Analysis of the neural activity suggests that individual Vg neurons simultaneously represent multiple mechanical features of a given stimulus, and that the neurons employ a distributed code to account for all available mechanical information. These results are guiding our development of simulation systems for whisking mechanics and whisking robots.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT THE SPEAKER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitra J.

Engerman&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;(Yale University) will serve as discussant, with&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Valentina Izmirlieva&lt;/strong&gt;, Director of the Harriman Institute, as moderator.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;It is well known that the Harriman Institute&amp;rsquo;s predecessor, the Russian Institute, established in 1946, was the first area studies center in the United States devoted to multidisciplinary teaching of and research on Russia. David Engerman&amp;rsquo;s path-breaking monograph &lt;em&gt;Know Your Enemy&lt;/em&gt; relates the focused philanthropy with which the Rockefeller Foundation began to support area studies in the 1930s, encouraged innovations during World War II, and finally poured over a million dollars into the Columbia project, making it preeminent.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;What is less well known is that the Rockefeller Foundation was not only interested in establishing area studies in the US for patriotic purposes, but also made grants in the late 1940s and 1950s to set up or strengthen area studies centers all over the &amp;ldquo;free world&amp;rdquo; in order to provide cross-cutting knowledge to policy communities everywhere in the hope that better information would lead to better international relations. These connections radiating from New York can be construed as an additional Cold War front. In this project, Slavic Studies would have a special place, and Columbia, the flagship of American Slavic studies, would serve as both model for and host to leading scholars with leading roles at their home institutions.&amp;nbsp;This research makes use of Rockefeller Foundation and Columbia University archives, as well as memoir materials from Japan and Germany.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;h2&gt;Ways to Attend&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_FlzKRh54T1WeV0geShfJhA\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Register for Zoom Webinar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/xGkDEOVE8nA\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Watch on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;In-person (CUID Only):&lt;strong&gt; Reserve Your Seat&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(see button below)&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "carly_jackson", "location": "International Affairs Building, 420 W. 118 St., New York, NY 10027", "timestamp": "2022-05-04 12:00:00-04:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "International and Public Affairs"}, {"tagName": "Morningside"}], "attendee": []}

You may register for one, or some or all sessions. Virtual joining information will be sent to registrants ahead of each session. Please note that because these sessions are workshops, the recordings will not be available.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;From October 2021 to May 2022, the Irish poet and conflict mediator&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;P&amp;aacute;draig &amp;Oacute; Tuama&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;will be in residence with the International Center for Cooperation and Conflict Resolution at Teachers College, as well as Columbia&amp;rsquo;s Earth Institute, Columbia Climate School.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;His project during this time is exploring dynamics of conflict and sustainability through the lens of poetry.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Poetry is a communicative technology that has emerged from every culture on earth. For as long as there&amp;rsquo;s been literature, individuals have turned to poetry for the purpose of communicating what mere sentences cannot communicate. At poetry&amp;rsquo;s heart can be ambivalence, rage, lament, resistance, regression, the murky world of dreams, and anxiety. In this way, poetry is primed to provide interest into the human animal&amp;rsquo;s behavior during times of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The outcome of P&amp;aacute;draig &amp;Oacute; Tuama&amp;#39;s residency at Columbia will be a publication that will pair 35 poems with insight about conflict - connecting them with major themes expressed in the award-winning&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Handbook of Conflict Resolution: Theory and Practice&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(2014). This includes conflict between individuals; conflict in groups; ambivalent responses to conflict; regression, aggression, and resistance; cooperation and negotiation; as well as conflict as a state of existence in the current climate crisis. Ground Rules will explore what it means to be grounded in human emotion, in physical space, in historical and post-colonial contexts, and in collaboration with each other for the purpose of moving towards flourishing and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;P&amp;aacute;draig &amp;Oacute; Tuama presents&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Poetry Unbound&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;from&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;On Being&lt;/em&gt;, a podcast that began in early 2020. Just about to start its fourth season in the Fall of 2021, this podcast has already exceeded six million downloads. A book from the podcast is forthcoming (October 2021) from WW Norton.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;P&amp;aacute;draig &amp;Oacute; Tuama&amp;rsquo;s published work includes poetry (Readings from the Book of Exile, Sorry for your Troubles, Canterbury Press 2012 and 2013), Theology (Daily Prayer and Borders and Belonging; Canterbury Press 2017 and 2021) and memoir In the Shelter (Broadleaf Books, 2021). A former leader of Corrymeela, Ireland&amp;rsquo;s oldest peace organisation, he combines interest in language, religion and conflict in all his written work. A frequent guest on long-form radio, his interviews have been featured on national broadcasters in Ireland, the UK, the USA, Australia and New Zealand. His poems have been published in the Harvard Review, Gutter, Cream City Review, Poetry Ireland and many more. Alongside multiple professional accreditations in conflict mediation, &amp;Oacute; Tuama holds a BA and MTh in Theology, and is a current PhD candidate in the School of Critical Studies at the University of Glasgow, exploring poetry and prayer under the supervision of Prof Heather Walton and Dr Samuel Tongue.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please register on Eventbrite here:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://poetrylab.eventbrite.com\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;https://poetrylab.eventbrite.com&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "climate_school_events", "location": "Online Event", "timestamp": "2022-05-04 14:30:00-04:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Arts"}, {"tagName": "Online"}, {"tagName": "Humanities"}, {"tagName": "International and Public Affairs"}], "attendee": []}

The disparity between Poland and several Western countries, first noted in the 1980s, was repeatedly associated with the different gender politics in the capitalist West and (post)state socialist East. The talk will examine this explanation to show how the ratio was employed as a comparative and ultimately normative tool. Janion hopes to elucidate the interrelations between (trans)sexuality and anxieties over European geopolitics in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;h2&gt;Ways to Attend&lt;/h2&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_eyaQ-keTQXmqjUhA3FWBuA\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Register for Zoom Webinar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/lY66By3JshE\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Watch on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "carly_jackson", "location": "Online", "timestamp": "2022-05-07 12:00:00-04:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Online"}, {"tagName": "International and Public Affairs"}], "attendee": []}

In our system, CO2 removal is a byproduct of wastewater treatment, enables recovery of valuable raw material, and serves as a cost-reduction. Analogous to a thermodynamic chemical system, CO2 sequestration becomes economically &amp;quot;spontaneous&amp;quot;, and its scale directly couples with demand for essential raw materials. Thus, it becomes possible to build scaled CO2 removal into core industrial operations. Functionally, our system represents a negative point source emission of CO2. This talk will present the basic concept we&amp;#39;re employing, its basis in carbon cycling and established CO2 removal strategies, and how the system interfaces with the environment.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\nMichael Long founded Renaissance Fiber in 2018 in response to loosening of restrictions on cultivation of industrial hemp in the US. Renaissance Fiber seeks to produce clean natural materials from hemp for textiles and other industries. Prior to founding Renaissance Fiber, Michael was a post-doc and research associate at Harvard University&amp;#39;s John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, focusing on atmospheric and ocean chemistry and physics. He has a B.S. in Meterology from N.C. State University, an M.S. in Marine Science from the University of North Carolina - Wilmington, and a Ph.D. in Environmental Sciences from the University of Virginia.

This framework (necessarily) results in empirical tradeoffs (Pareto frontiers) between fairness and accuracy that can be chosen by stakeholders. After surveying these developments, I will describe an alternative approach inspired by the concept of &amp;ldquo;bias bounties&amp;rdquo; that manages to sidestep such tradeoffs. In this approach, a simple algorithm can incorporate proposed improvements to a trained model in a way that monotonically improves not only subgroup fairness but overall accuracy. Time permitting, I will describe an ongoing communal experiment in such a bias bounty.&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "daniel_hsu", "location": "Department of Computer Science, 500 W. 120th St., New York, New York 10027", "timestamp": "2022-05-09 11:40:00-04:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Online"}], "attendee": []}

During the twentieth century, Iranian Jews experienced rapid upward mobility, migrated within the country and abroad, participated in significant political and social movements, and integrated into several layers of Iranian society. This talk will explore the landscape of Jewish identity in Iran during the 20th century, with a special focus on Jewish-Muslim interactions, political engagement and aspirations, and the intersection of education and integration. As we examine how Iranian Jews navigated between their Iranian and Jewish identities in an era of new nationalisms, we gain insight into what Jewish emancipation and assimilation looked like in a Muslim-majority country. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Daniella Farah &lt;/strong&gt;is a 2021-2023 Samuel W. and Goldye Marian Spain Postdoctoral Fellow in Jewish Studies at Rice University.

Shevchenko in forging Ukrainian identity, it is important that his legacy as an artist (and first and foremost, as a poet) should not be the exclusive property of Shevchenko scholars and, worst of all, ideologues of different shapes and stripes. To turn a poet into an icon or a monument would have a very detrimental effect on anything he stands for, and on the whole Ukrainian national project. And that is why each generation of Ukrainians should have a fresh look at his life and his works. It is not only their right, it is their duty. And the basic questions they have to address are: Is he really a good poet? Does his life and work justify his status as a father figure of a modern nation? Does his writing still resonate with us? The book &amp;ldquo;\u0421\u0432\u0456\u0436\u0438\u043c \u043e\u043a\u043e\u043c. \u0428\u0435\u0432\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0441\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0447\u0430&amp;rdquo; (Rereading Taras Shevchenko) tries to tackle all these issues.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The book is written from a perspective of a contemporary Ukrainian reader, properly educated, open-minded and neither politically, nor ideologically motivated.

First published in Belgrade as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Filosofija palanke&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;in 1969, it attracted keen attention and controversy through its unsparing critique of Serbian and any other nationalism in Yugoslavia and beyond. The book was prophetic, seeming to anticipate not only the bloody disintegration of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, but also the totalitarian turn in politics across the globe in the first decades of the new century. With this translation, English-speaking audiences can at last discover one of the most original writers of eastern European late modernism, and gain an important and original perspective into contemporary politics and culture in the West and beyond. This is a book that seems to age in reverse, as its meanings become deeper and more universal with the passage of time.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Konstantinovi\u0107&amp;rsquo;s&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;book&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;resists easy classification, mixing classical, Montaigne-like essay, prose poetry, novel, and literary history. The word &amp;ldquo;philosophy&amp;rdquo; in the book&amp;rsquo;s title refers to the solitary activity of reflection and critical thinking, and is also paradoxical: according to the author, a defining characteristic of parochialism is precisely its intolerance toward this kind of self-reflexivity. In Konstantinovi\u0107&amp;rsquo;s analysis, parochialism is not a simply a characteristic of a geographical region or a cultural, political, and historical formation&amp;mdash;these are all just manifestations of the parochial spirit as the spirit of insularity. His book illuminates the current moment, in which insularity undergirds not only ethnic and national divisions, but also dictates the very structure of everyday life, and where individuals can easily find themselves locked in an echo chamber of social media.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Philosophy of Parochialism&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;can help us understand better not only the dead ends of ethnic nationalism and other atavistic ideologies, but also of those cultural forces such as digital technologies that have been built on the promise of overcoming those ideologies.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;h2&gt;Ways to Attend&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_6gZ5zmF-RlqRYNtk-RjjFQ\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Register for Zoom Webinar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/VJrEapj4DUw\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Watch on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;In-person (CUID Only):&lt;strong&gt; Reserve Your Seat&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(see button below)&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "carly_jackson", "location": "International Affairs Building, 420 W. 118 St., New York, NY 10027", "timestamp": "2022-05-09 18:30:00-04:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "International and Public Affairs"}, {"tagName": "Morningside"}], "attendee": []}

A growing body of evidence shows that the interactions of intrinsic and extrinsic factors, across length scales from molecules to organisms, contribute to the rates of ageing and age-associated diseases in humans. However, it is unclear how underlying molecular states of an individual relate to their clinical outlook. We postulate that studying age-associated changes at intermediate length scales of cells may provide a key link to understand ageing patterns. As integrators of molecular signals, cells offer a sensitive meso-scale view of ageing, with cellular dysfunctions likely occurring prior to the manifestation of age-associated diseases. In the seminar, I will present: how biophysical properties of cells constitute a framework to study ageing, the role of cellular heterogeneity in propagating ageing phenotypes, and a generalizable framework to understand emergent patterns of single-cell motility with applications for healthy ageing and disease.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT THE SPEAKER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jude Phillip, Ph.D.&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering, Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, and Oncology; Core Member,&amp;nbsp;Institute for Nanobiotechnology (INBT), Johns Hopkins University&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Jude Phillip is an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering, with secondary appointments in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Oncology, and is a core member in the Institute for Nanobiotechnology (INBT) at Johns Hopkins University. He completed his B.Eng. in Chemical Engineering at CCNY, a PhD in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, and postdoctoral training at Weill Cornell Medicine. At Johns Hopkins his lab studies biological ageing dynamics in health and disease. He combines fundamental engineering approaches with ageing and oncology research to develop translatable strategies and technologies to probe ageing and disease.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT THE 2021-2022 BME SEMINAR SERIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The Department of Biomedical Engineering at Columbia University is proud to host an annual weekly seminar series on the latest developments and research in Biomedical Engineering.

Jolted by the illegal annexation of Crimea and by the invasion of the Donbas region, for years Ukrainian creative individuals have been developing innovative and challenging art that explores themes such as memory, gender, and displacement. The all-out attack on Ukraine&amp;rsquo;s existence begun on February 24th has further challenged these artists to respond creatively and to ensure the country&amp;rsquo;s survival.

Equally comfortable expounding on the American soul to a group of schoolkids as he is with the minutiae of city government, Wolberg&amp;rsquo;s public face hides some disturbing private troubles: at home he&amp;rsquo;s increasingly estranged from his wife, and his two teenage children don&amp;rsquo;t get him&amp;mdash;nor he they. As the emotional fault lines that surround the good mayor begin to split apart around the time of his daughter&amp;rsquo;s 18th birthday, Simon must struggle to hold his family together.

For as long as there&amp;rsquo;s been literature, individuals have turned to poetry for the purpose of communicating what mere sentences cannot communicate. At poetry&amp;rsquo;s heart can be ambivalence, rage, lament, resistance, regression, the murky world of dreams, and anxiety. In this way, poetry is primed to provide interest into the human animal&amp;rsquo;s behavior during times of conflict.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The outcome of P&amp;aacute;draig &amp;Oacute; Tuama&amp;#39;s residency at Columbia will be a publication that will pair 35 poems with insight about conflict - connecting them with major themes expressed in the award-winning&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Handbook of Conflict Resolution: Theory and Practice&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(2014). This includes conflict between individuals; conflict in groups; ambivalent responses to conflict; regression, aggression, and resistance; cooperation and negotiation; as well as conflict as a state of existence in the current climate crisis. Ground Rules will explore what it means to be grounded in human emotion, in physical space, in historical and post-colonial contexts, and in collaboration with each other for the purpose of moving towards flourishing and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;P&amp;aacute;draig &amp;Oacute; Tuama presents&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Poetry Unbound&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;from&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;On Being&lt;/em&gt;, a podcast that began in early 2020. Just about to start its fourth season in the Fall of 2021, this podcast has already exceeded six million downloads. A book from the podcast is forthcoming (October 2021) from WW Norton.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;P&amp;aacute;draig &amp;Oacute; Tuama&amp;rsquo;s published work includes poetry (Readings from the Book of Exile, Sorry for your Troubles, Canterbury Press 2012 and 2013), Theology (Daily Prayer and Borders and Belonging; Canterbury Press 2017 and 2021) and memoir In the Shelter (Broadleaf Books, 2021). A former leader of Corrymeela, Ireland&amp;rsquo;s oldest peace organisation, he combines interest in language, religion and conflict in all his written work. A frequent guest on long-form radio, his interviews have been featured on national broadcasters in Ireland, the UK, the USA, Australia and New Zealand. His poems have been published in the Harvard Review, Gutter, Cream City Review, Poetry Ireland and many more. Alongside multiple professional accreditations in conflict mediation, &amp;Oacute; Tuama holds a BA and MTh in Theology, and is a current PhD candidate in the School of Critical Studies at the University of Glasgow, exploring poetry and prayer under the supervision of Prof Heather Walton and Dr Samuel Tongue.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please register on Eventbrite here:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://poetrylab.eventbrite.com\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;https://poetrylab.eventbrite.com&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "climate_school_events", "location": "Online Event", "timestamp": "2022-05-11 14:30:00-04:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Arts"}, {"tagName": "Online"}, {"tagName": "Humanities"}, {"tagName": "International and Public Affairs"}], "attendee": []}

The presentations are held via Zoom and are open to the Columbia community and to researchers outside Columbia University.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, March 17th (4:00-5:00 PM, EST), IICD welcomes &lt;a href=\"https://camara-lab.org\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Pablo G.

The cell composition of a tumor at any time point is the result of multiple dynamic cellular processes, including tumor-derived cell differentiation processes, paracrine communication between tumor cells and the microenvironment, and evolution from selective pressure and clonal competition. The application of concepts from metric geometry to the study of tumor configuration spaces provides a natural mathematical framework for making inferences about these continuous and dynamic cellular processes. In this talk, I will present a geometric approach for estimating dynamic cell abundances from gene expression data of bulk tissues using single-cell RNA-seq datasets as a reference. I will then illustrate the utility of this analytic approach with its application to the study of the drivers of mesenchymal transformation in pediatric ependymoma, a rare but devastating type of glioma in children.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bio: &lt;/strong&gt;Pablo G. C&amp;aacute;mara, Ph.D. is an Assistant Professor of Genetics at the University of Pennsylvania, Perelman School of Medicine, and a member of the Penn Institute for Biomedical Informatics and the Center for Artificial Intelligence and Data Science for Integrated Diagnostics. He received a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics from Universidad Autonoma de Madrid and performed research in this field for several years. Fascinated by the interesting and fundamental open questions in biology, in 2014 he shifted his research focus into quantitative biology. His current research utilizes principles of mathematics to address some of the problems that the complexity and scale of biological data pose to traditional computational methods. Drawing ideas from topology, geometry, statistics, physics, and computer science, and making use of high-throughput single-cell technologies and large-scale population studies, his group aims to achieve a more complete understanding of the cellular composition and signaling networks of tumors in relation to their genetics.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "lorenza_favrot", "location": "Online Event", "timestamp": "2022-05-17 16:00:00-04:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "Seminar"}, {"tagName": "Morningside"}], "attendee": []}

Despite these similarities, the demographic makeup of these two nations could not be more different: while roughly 55% of Brazil&amp;acute;s population identifies as black or mixed race, approximately 12% of Americans identify as black.

The discussion will explore the work of democracy promotion, what it got right, what it got wrong and what the future might hold.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Democracy promotion has been a key thematic understanding of US foreign policy globally, but particularly in this region.

Conveying empathy in human-human interaction as well as conversational systems can encourage users to like a speaker more, to believe the speaker is more intelligent, to actually take the speaker&amp;rsquo;s advice, to want to speak with the speaker longer and more often, to like the speaker and to trust it more. It can also be used to improve success in health-care advice-giving, as well as in negotiations and conflict resolution. Much research has been done in the past 20 years on creating responses that can convey empathy to one&amp;rsquo;s conversational partners in text, facial expression and gesture in conversational systems. However very little has been done to identify the speech features that can create an empathetic sounding voice. In this talk I will discuss some prior research on the importance of empathy in conversation as well as current, ongoing work in our lab on identifying acoustic-prosodic as well as lexical features characterizing empathetic speech, and how these features can be used to create empathetic voices.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julia Hirschberg&lt;/strong&gt; is Percy K. and Vida L.

What does not or does not yet exist plays a predominant role in science and technology. What do scientists look for and how does their way of searching influence what they find? The antechamber of discovery is not as, as is frequently thought, an inscrutable &amp;ldquo;private art&amp;rdquo; marked by a punctual &amp;ldquo;Eureka!&amp;rdquo; moment. It is a rich cultural, social, economic and political space where sought-after imaginary perpetrators have recognizable characteristics that have remained fairly constant throughout many centuries.

Along the way, he encounters people from all walks of life, and he learns as much about the Hungarians as about himself. In a narrative as absorbing as it is vital for the lessons it carries for a divided Western world: Can we get along with those on the other side of the fence? Is it worth even trying? His answers are surprising.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;By guiding us through a polarized landscape of differing opinions, Lasse Skytt delivers a broader perspective on Viktor Orb&amp;aacute;n&amp;rsquo;s Hungary, one that suggests possibilities for the future of Europe and America. His journey will leave us questioning our own truths, and, ultimately, which side we are on.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lasse Skytt &lt;/strong&gt;(born 1987) is a Danish foreign correspondent who has covered Hungary and Central Europe for for almost a decade.

Looking at this &amp;ldquo;flotsam&amp;rdquo; that washed ashore, we will explore the relationship between these objects and images and how they shaped the imagination and experiences of Europe and of ourselves. How did these objects, images and messages reach an otherwise impervious Albania? How did they circulate once in Albania and what life and meanings did they take on? Did this relationship with the &amp;ldquo;beyond&amp;rdquo;, cherished and suffered by the citizens-inmates of a country otherwise closed to the world, lead to an inadvertent &amp;ldquo;colonization&amp;rdquo; of minds by these ethereal images built by and for Western media?&amp;nbsp;Or, did these highly censored or scarcely available objects and images allow Albanians to clandestinely escape across the porous borders of the imagination?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;h2&gt;Speakers&lt;/h2&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ardian Vehbiu&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a linguist, writer, translator and independent scholar.

Each woman was illustrated by a different woman illustrator/designer/artist from Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The publishing of the book was financed by Open Society Foundation and by more than 500 crowdfunding supporters from all over the world.

An architect of twentieth-century neoclassicism, she experienced the transformative power of the Russian Revolution and created her greatest work - &lt;em&gt;Les Noces&lt;/em&gt; - under the influence of its avant-garde. Many of her ballets rested on the probing of gender boundaries, a mistrust of conventional gender roles, and the heightening of the ballerina&amp;#39;s technical and artistic prowess. A prominent member of Russia Abroad, she worked with leading figures of twentieth-century art, music, and ballet, including Stravinsky, Diaghilev, Poulenc, Alexandra Exter, Natalia Goncharova, Frederick Ashton, Alicia Markova, and Maria Tallchief. She was also a remarkable dancer in her own right with a bravura technique and powerful stage presence that enabled her to perform an unusually broad repertory. Finally, she was the author of an acclaimed volume of memoirs in addition to a major treatise on movement. Nijinska&amp;#39;s career sheds new light on the modern history of ballet and of modernism more generally, recuperating the memory of lost works and forgotten artists, many of them women. But it also reveals the sexism pervasive in the upper echelons of the early and mid-twentieth-century ballet world, barriers that women choreographers still confront.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;h2&gt;Ways to Attend&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_V4ebVj4gQ1aoOj6JjceOdQ\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Register for Zoom Webinar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/6W4V545H6K0\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Watch on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;In-person (CUID Only):&lt;strong&gt; Reserve Your Seat&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(see button below)&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;", "organizerId": "carly_jackson", "location": "International Affairs Building, 420 W. 118 St., New York, NY 10027", "timestamp": "2022-05-25 17:00:00-04:00", "tags": [{"tagName": "International and Public Affairs"}, {"tagName": "Morningside"}], "attendee": []}
